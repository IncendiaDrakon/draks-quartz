### ðŸ”— To **link** to a tag page

Use Quartzâ€™s internal link syntax:

- `[[tags/plugin]]` â†’ links to the tag page for `#plugin`
- You can also use `[Plugin Notes](tags/plugin)` for cleaner display

This works just like folder listings, and you can even embed tag pages in other notes or dashboards.
