[[quartz structure brainstorming]]

It seems like quartz doesn't support multi hashtag searching

I'll have to figure out if that's even a thing that I could try and configure for my site 

If not I was brainstorming about creating pages that act as a sort of tag hub 

For example a render page that links to other pages. Each of those pages will have links or back links to content 

Now I guess the three types of pages would be NSFW sfw and all 

This could get cumbersome fast so I'm not really sure if that's the sound strategy 

It's probably best to just sort things into folders. Then use clear tags such as "FFXIV Vallia NSFW Render"
