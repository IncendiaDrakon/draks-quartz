For note YAML frontmatter field:
- type: universe

I might change this later if things get too confusing. Right now this anchor note is used for other {universe anchor} notes to clarify the type of anchor it is. In this case a universe anchor note. I think it also serves as a quick reference for the universes I'm established in, as opposed to linear hierarchy like:

\[\[Universes]] -> \[\[Final Fantasy]] -> \[\[Final Fantasy XIV]] -> \[\[Final Fantasy XIV - Drakiverse]]
