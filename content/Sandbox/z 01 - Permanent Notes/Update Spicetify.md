Sometimes when launching Spotify, it'll update. You'll need to reapply/update Spicetify to make it work again. Do this via Windows Powershell.

```Windows-Powershell
spicetify update
```

## Basic Usage

After installing Spicetify and Spicetify's Marketplace, you can use it to customize your Spotify client using all the available **extensions** and **themes** found in the Marketplace.

### Updating

**_Spotify_**, every now and then, **updates** its client. Since we have no power over this process, you will likely need to **re-apply Spicetify**.

However, the update might have major changes to the client, which means you will need to run `spicetify update` (`spicetify upgrade` in Spicetify versions **below 2.27.0**) every time you update Spotify. If no update for Spicetify is available, it means that it either still works by simply running `spicetify backup apply`, or that we are still **working on updating Spicetify** to work on the new version.
