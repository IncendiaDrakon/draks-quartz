Map of Content or MoC is a term coined by Obsidian users for a note that acts as a sort of index or central hub for other notes. It links to other notes which could then branch off to other related notes. The purpose is to free yourself from rigid folder structures in a Zettelkasten style approach to encourage free thinking and organization of related thoughts or subjects.

I asked some AI chatbots/LLMs to define it:
	[[moc defined by Google Gemini]]
	[[moc defined by microsoft copilot]]

Additionally they came up with some aliases for this note:
