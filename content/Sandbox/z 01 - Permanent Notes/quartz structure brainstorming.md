[[my quartz 4 site]]

Writing some notes before I forget. I think my basic idea was something like

landing page
- what I do
	- renders
	- screenshots
	- writing
	- mods
- content directories
- lore

I've got ffxiv content that's split between 
- screenshots
- renders
- mods

I'm still not sure how to structure the site but I could probably leverage the home page best.
However, the initial concept was to have top level folders like
- ffxiv renders
- ffxiv screenshots
- other renders

Think about options for something like
	homepage -> ffxiv page
	homepage -> content
	homepage -> MoC
Tags could come in handy, but at this moment I'm not sure how to [[quartz link to a tag page|link to tag]] page. Apparently you can [[quartz edit tag page|edit a tag page]].

Ultimately leading end users to a page that exposes the chronological sorted posts folder is ideal.
