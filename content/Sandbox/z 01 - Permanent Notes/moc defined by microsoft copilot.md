[[Map of Content]]

Absolutely. In the context of **Obsidian**, a **Map of Content (MoC)** is:

> 🗺️ **A dedicated note that acts as a curated hub, linking out to a collection of related notes.**  
> It’s essentially a navigational tool—like a table of contents—that helps you organize and traverse your vault by topic, theme, or semantic cluster.

### 🔍 Key traits of a MoC in Obsidian:

- It’s **just a regular note**, but intentionally structured to link to other notes.
- It can be formatted as **bullet lists, tables, embeds, or Dataview queries**.
- It supports **bottom-up and top-down thinking**—you can build it organically or plan it in advance.
- It’s central to the **“digital garden”** approach, where notes grow and evolve over time.
- It reduces reliance on folders and tags by using **links as the primary organizational method**.

Think of it as a semantic anchor that helps you **see relationships**, **reduce friction**, and **reconnect with your ideas**—especially useful when your vault starts sprawling.

If you’re building multiple MoCs (like for universes, characters, or workflows), you’re essentially creating a **modular navigation system**. Want help sketching out a few MoC templates tailored to your vault’s structure?
