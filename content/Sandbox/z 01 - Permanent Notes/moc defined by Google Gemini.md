[[Map of Content]]

In the context of the PC program Obsidian, a **Map of Content (MOC)** is a note that serves as a hub, index, or table of contents for a group of other related notes.

Rather than relying solely on a rigid folder structure, MOCs leverage Obsidian's linking capabilities to create a flexible and interconnected knowledge system. They provide a high-level overview of a topic, project, or area of interest, making it easier to navigate and understand the relationships between different ideas.

Key characteristics of an MOC include:

- **A central note:** The MOC itself is a single note within your Obsidian vault.
    
- **Links to other notes:** The core of an MOC is a collection of links to other notes that fall under its topic. These links can be organized in various ways, such as a bulleted list, a descriptive paragraph, or a hierarchical outline.
    
- **Active thinking tool:** MOCs are not just static indexes. They are a tool for active thinking and sense-making. As you add more notes and discover new connections, you can reorganize the MOC to reflect your evolving understanding of a topic. This process of curation helps you see new relationships and synthesize ideas.
    
- **Flexibility:** An MOC can be as simple or as complex as you need it to be. A single MOC can link to other MOCs, creating a nested hierarchy that allows you to manage a vast amount of information.
    
- **Reduces reliance on folders and tags:** While folders and tags are still useful, MOCs offer an alternative or supplementary way to organize your notes. They allow you to group notes based on their content and relationships, rather than a fixed folder location.
    

Think of an MOC as a personalized "map" of your thoughts on a particular subject, guiding you through the landscape of your notes and helping you find and connect ideas.
