Continuing from [[personal or public site]] 

I'm more or less currently settled on properly setting up a Quartz 4 powered site for all my renders/etc.

I can easily host it from github (still need an nsfw friendly host) with github pages. I have a repo for my quartz vault and it's named after my github pages user site.
