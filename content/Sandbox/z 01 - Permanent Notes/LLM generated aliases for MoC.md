# Microsoft Copilot:

You've already got a solid lineup of aliases that cover most of the common MoC terminology. Nicely done. Here are a few more you might consider, depending on how you use the note and what kind of semantic signaling you want:

### ðŸ§­ Additional MoC-style aliases to consider:

- **Dashboard** â€” often used when the note includes queries, embeds, or dynamic content.
- **Home Note** â€” popular in digital garden setups as the root or entry point.
- **Landing Page** â€” especially fitting if the note introduces a topic or universe branch.
- **Overview** â€” useful for summarizing a cluster of notes.
- **Navigation Note** â€” emphasizes its role in guiding traversal.
- **Directory** â€” evokes a more archival or index-like tone.
- **Portal** â€” great for creative or narrative contexts (Drakiverse vibes, perhaps?).
- **Start Here** â€” informal but intuitive for onboarding or entry points.

You might also play with **contextual aliases** like:

- `Vallia Index`
- `Drakiverse Hub`
- `Canon/AU Navigator`

These can help Dataview queries or backlinks feel more narratively grounded. Want to sketch out a few MoC variants that reflect different rolesâ€”like character anchors vs. universe scaffolds?

Absolutelyâ€”hereâ€™s a compact, metadata-friendly YAML snippet that rolls up both your original aliases and the expanded set, tailored for MoC-style notes in Obsidian:

```yaml
aliases:
  - Map of Content
  - MoC
  - Index
  - Index Note
  - Table of Contents
  - Glossary
  - Hub Note
  - Structure Note
  - Dashboard
  - Home Note
  - Landing Page
  - Overview
  - Navigation Note
  - Directory
  - Portal
  - Start Here
  - Drakiverse Hub
  - Vallia Index
  - Canon/AU Navigator
```

ðŸŽ¯ _Modular usage tips_:

- You can selectively include aliases based on contextâ€”e.g. `Portal` or `Drakiverse Hub` for lore navigation, `Dashboard` if itâ€™s query-heavy.
- If you're using Dataview to surface MoC notes, these aliases can help auto-filter via `contains(aliases, "Map of Content")` or similar logic.

Want a matching frontmatter scaffold to tag MoC types or navigation roles more granularly? We could add Boolean flags or semantic categories to support multiple dashboards.
