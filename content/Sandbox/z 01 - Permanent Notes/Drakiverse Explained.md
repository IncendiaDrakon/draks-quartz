## Drakiverse ✨  
A personal tag and semantic anchor used to signify that the content is part of *my own canon*—a reinterpretation or alternate take on a given universe or franchise.  
The name is a portmanteau of "Drakon" and "Universe"—**Drakon's Universe**—and acts as a narrative umbrella across all my creative threads.  

Where the official canon ends, the Drakiverse begins.

### How it's used
- As a suffix to distinguish personal lore branches:  
  `Final Fantasy XIV – Drakiverse` | `BG3 – Drakiverse`
- As a frontmatter label:  
  `verse: Drakiverse` | `isDrakiverse: true`
- As a tag across notes, images, and creative fragments to denote ownership, headcanon, and OC-driven interpretations.

### Core Concepts  
- Contains remixed lore, original characters, and thematic adaptations.
- Supports multiversal structuring—branches, AUs, forks, and narrative overlays.
- Vallia is often the anchor, echoing through different worlds with localized shifts.

The Drakiverse is not just where content lives—it’s where identity, myth, and remix converge.
