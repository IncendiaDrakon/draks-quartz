## Scene Summary

Iriali kneels before Vallia in the candlelit quiet of the ruined abbey, ostensibly in prayer. But her devotion becomes a sensual act — a touch at the thigh, lips grazing skin, her breath quickening as reverence bleeds into desire.

## Scene Beats

- Iriali touches Vallia’s thigh as part of a blessing
- Vallia shifts, testing Iriali’s reaction
- Iriali’s hands explore more than intended
- The contact lingers — not holy, but intimate
- Iriali trembles with anticipation

## Focus

Worship through physicality. The blurred line between sacred duty and personal hunger.
