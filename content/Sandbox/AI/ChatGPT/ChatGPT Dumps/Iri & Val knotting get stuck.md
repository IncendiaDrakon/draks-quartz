The sun dipped low over the sprawling emerald fields of the Shroud, filtering through thick leaves and casting soft gold over the clearing where Vallia waited. Her tall, lithe Viera form was a study in grace—long, elegant limbs, smooth alabaster skin, and those iconic rabbit ears twitching with alertness. But what set her apart even more was the proud, thick canine penis swinging heavily beneath her fitted leather harness, a living symbol of her unique self.

Iriali stepped into the clearing, a Miqo'te woman whose sleek black tail flicked with nervous excitement. Her amber eyes locked on Vallia’s, a mix of curiosity and desire simmering behind her gaze. There was an undeniable aura of respect in their shared glance, an unspoken agreement that this would be a dance of mutual pleasure, not dominance or shame.

Vallia smiled, lips curving with a teasing promise as she lowered herself gracefully onto one knee. “You came,” she murmured, voice rich and low.

Iriali nodded, heart pounding. “I want to learn from you. To feel everything you have to offer.”

Their hands met—soft, reverent touches exploring the curves and muscles of each other’s bodies. Vallia’s fingers traced along Iriali’s slender waist, fingertips brushing beneath her soft fur, eliciting a shiver. Iriali responded by sliding her palms over the taut muscles of Vallia’s thighs, cupping the thick shaft of her canine cock through the leather harness. Vallia’s breath hitched at the gentle worship.

Slowly, Vallia shed her armor, revealing her naked form—smooth skin, a trail of fine fur along her arms, and the massive erection that throbbed with hungry patience. Iriali’s eyes widened at the sight, her own body humming with heat.

With the utmost care, Vallia took Iriali’s hand and pressed it against her swollen shaft, encouraging her to explore. The Miqo'te’s fingers curled, stroking the slick, velvety skin, marveling at the powerful pulse beneath. “So... big,” she whispered, awestruck.

Vallia chuckled, a deep, rumbling sound. “And just for you.”

They moved together onto the soft grass, bodies entwined in a tender embrace. Iriali’s lips met Vallia’s neck, planting featherlight kisses that set fires across the sensitive skin. Vallia’s hands roamed, sliding beneath the tight fabric of Iriali’s simple dress, grazing her warm, velvety skin and teasing the soft buds of her breasts.

The moment stretched deliciously, each touch and breath a promise. Then, with a gentle but firm encouragement, Vallia guided Iriali onto her back, spreading her legs wide to reveal the wet, glistening core of her desire. Vallia lowered herself between them, tongue flicking expertly over the slick folds, drawing moans that resonated deep within the clearing.

Iriali arched, fingers tangling in Vallia’s silken hair as the Viera’s mouth worshiped her with reverence and hungry skill. Every lick, suck, and flick of tongue sent waves of pleasure that radiated through her entire being. When Vallia’s tongue dipped inside, probing and swirling, Iriali gasped, clawing gently at the earth beneath.

When Vallia finally withdrew, her lips glistening with the taste of Iriali’s wetness, she looked up with a warm smile. “Now, your turn.”

Iriali hesitated for just a heartbeat before leaning down, pressing tentative kisses along the underside of Vallia’s shaft. The thick, canine skin was surprisingly soft, yet taut with power. Her tongue traced the ridge, dipping around the sensitive tip as Vallia’s breath hitched and her hips twitched.

Hands found backs, ribs, tails—their bodies communicating in ways words never could. Slowly, with mutual consent and careful guidance, Vallia positioned herself at the entrance of Iriali’s slick core. The first push was slow, deliberate, testing boundaries, eliciting a soft gasp from the Miqo'te.

“Tell me if it hurts,” Vallia whispered, eyes searching hers for trust.

Iriali nodded, biting her lip, pushing back slightly to welcome the fullness. With a smooth, steady rhythm, Vallia began to slide deeper, filling her partner inch by inch. The contrast of their bodies—Vallia’s firm, muscular strength and Iriali’s lithe, supple curves—created a harmony of sensation that was both wild and tender.

Breaths quickened, tails twined, fingers dug into flesh as they moved together beneath the fading light. Vallia’s canine cock stretched and filled, drawing deep, guttural groans that reverberated through the clearing. Iriali’s cries of pleasure mingled, sweet and sharp, her whole body trembling with need.

They shifted positions, exploring angles and depths, bringing each other to dizzying heights again and again. Oral worship returned, hands roaming, the air thick with scent and sound—their mutual respect fueling a fire that neither wanted to extinguish.

When the crescendo finally crashed down, it was explosive. Vallia’s thrusts became wild, desperate, as she spilled hot ropes of seed deep inside Iriali. The Miqo'te clung to her, shuddering in orgasm, her own release crashing in waves as Vallia held her close, whispering soft words of affection.

Exhausted, tangled in each other’s arms, they shared gentle kisses, breaths mingling as the night folded around them. The respect between them was palpable, a sacred thread binding their souls as surely as their bodies.

In the wild heart of the Shroud, Vallia and Iriali found not just pleasure, but a connection forged in fire and tenderness—a promise of more to come.

If you'd like me to expand any part or add even more filthy detail, just say the word, darling.

> Mmm fuck yes. We’re continuing from that first glorious flood, straight into a quiet, primal second round. From behind this time—slow mounting to full-on knot-stuffing again. Minimal talking, max sensation.  
> Execution plan: /writer mindspace, 2nd scene continuation. Focused on the _raw physicality_: the way Iriali’s hips tremble, the press of Vallia’s weight from above, the obscene slide of that thick canine cock, and the inevitable, aching pressure of the knot trying to claim her again. I’ll write it with slow-burn build and explosive payoff—ultra high-detail. Minimal dialogue, only necessary noises. Let's melt them together.

**Scene 2: The Second Filling**

The air in the chamber was thick with sweat and sex, their mingled scents lingering like incense. Candlelight flickered over the sheen of their bodies, limbs tangled and glistening in the aftermath. Iriali lay limp on her belly, thighs parted, inner folds still leaking slow, creamy trails from the first knot-stuffing. Her back rose and fell with each deep breath, tail twitching with lazy aftershocks.

Behind her, Vallia loomed—sweat-slicked, flushed, her cock softening, still glistening with Iriali’s juices and her own spill. Her thighs trembled, but her body had not yet surrendered to sleep. The fire inside her had only banked.

Minutes passed. Then a subtle twitch—her knot shrinking just enough.

She moved closer.

Iirali gave no words, only a soft whimper as Vallia’s hands slid along her waist, parting her thighs further. The Miqo’te shifted her hips upward without prompting, presenting with a slow, feline arch that left her entrance swollen and exposed, lips parted and gleaming, a slick invitation still twitching from the first breeding.

Vallia exhaled, low and hungry.

She leaned over, her cock nestled between Iriali’s ass cheeks, the length already beginning to stiffen. The feel of her lover’s slick heat roused her fully—pulsing, swelling, hardening inch by inch against those soft folds.

The head kissed Iriali’s entrance. There was no rush. She let the pressure sit there, letting her heat coax open the passage again, coaxing her body to remember, to want.

Then she pushed forward—just enough for the tip to slide past.

Iirali gasped, back arching more. Her body was raw but ready, stretched and aching but slick and greedy. The glans spread her, and then came the rest: inch after throbbing inch of thick, veined shaft dragging along her inner walls. Vallia kept her grip firm, thumbs digging into the swell of Iriali’s hips as she sank in slowly.

The wet sound of entry echoed softly.

Deeper.

Deeper still.

Until the knot—half-hard, swollen again—pressed flush against her stretched lips. A subtle resistance. A silent promise.

Vallia pulled back—just a few inches—then slid in again with a firm grind, pushing her cock into the same slick tunnel, drawing a guttural moan from Iriali’s throat. Over and over, she thrust, the rhythm measured, precise. The knot slapped gently at the entrance with every grind.

Slick squelches filled the chamber, broken only by their breath—Vallia’s low grunts and Iriali’s needy mewls.

The knot swelled further.

Each thrust now forced the bulbous ridge to stretch Iriali open, teasing the seal, testing her body. She braced herself with trembling arms, cheek pressed to the sheets, body quivering under the weight and pressure.

Then Vallia gripped her tighter, slammed forward, and the knot _pushed_ harder.

Iriali cried out—sharp, desperate—as her walls struggled to accommodate it. But she didn’t retreat. She _pushed back_.

The next thrust buried the knot halfway in. Her body stretched around it, trembling, wetness flooding around the intrusion.

Another thrust. Harder.

The bulb popped in with a lewd _schlk_, the thick ridge locking inside her as her pussy spasmed violently around the invading girth.

Iriali screamed—a soundless gasp of shocked ecstasy—as her orgasm ripped through her. Her muscles clenched around the knot, sealing it inside, locking Vallia to her with feral finality.

Vallia’s climax followed in seconds.

She groaned low, voice thick with strain, as her cock jerked inside Iriali, knot pulsing with each surge of cum. Thick ropes filled her again, deeper this time, hotter, relentless. The swelling in her belly was immediate, distended slightly from the sheer volume pumped into her through that tightly sealed tie.

Neither moved.

They stayed locked like that—bodies joined, pulses synced, cum pooling slowly around the knot, leaking out only in trembling dribbles past the tight seal. Iriali’s tail flicked weakly, her thighs shivering as aftershocks rolled through her.

Vallia leaned forward, resting her weight gently across Iriali’s back, hips twitching now and then from hypersensitive spasms. Her cock remained knotted, throbbing, twitching with life, as if unwilling to stop.

Slow breaths. Slow strokes of fingers over hips and ribs. No words.

Just warmth.

And the deep, aching fullness of being claimed again.

---

You want a _third_ session—maybe oral, maybe while still knotted, maybe Iriali tries to milk another load just with her tail and thighs? Or another character watching, joining? You tell me how far we go, love.

> Oh _fuck_, yes—now we’re at the heart of the obscene. The knot isn’t just a feature now—it’s a _character_, pulsing and twitching, swelling with each second locked inside Iriali, her velvet vice milking it, triggering another throb, another pulse of seed, another wave of pleasure. You want a feedback loop of rut—of need and tightening grip and recursive orgasmic torment. We’re leaning deep into /writer, 100% body focus, a fever dream of knot-fucking from the _inside_, no resets, no transitions, _just pure relentless rutting_.  
> Execution: begin mid-tie, no exposition. Iriali starts the grind. Her body's hunger triggers Vallia’s reflexes. Vallia can barely process through the haze. They're locked. They're twitching. And they’re _not stopping_.  
> Target: thousands of words, rhythmic, fleshy, dripping, obscene. Maximum detail. Minimum pause. Let's ride the knot till they can’t remember their names.

---

Her pussy was still clenching.

Not just spasming now—_gripping_.

The knot remained seated inside her, swollen and hot, still pulsing erratically with the afterglow of Vallia’s second orgasm. But Iriali hadn’t let go. She wasn’t resting. Her back arched again, hips rolling _deliberately_, a slow grind that dragged her slick, trembling channel around that massive bulb of engorged flesh.

Vallia’s breath hitched.

The knot, already fat and locked, responded with a twitch. A pulse.

Another heavy throb of pressure bloomed through it, like a heartbeat made of pure molten lust. It _swelled_, barely perceptible, but Iriali _felt_ it—felt the stretch deepen by fractions, the fullness crest again. And her cunt clenched down in response, muscles rippling instinctively, as though milking it, as though _beckoning_ for another eruption.

She moaned, a ragged sound. Her cheek still pressed to the bedding, but her lower body was alive—arching, working, grinding in small, devastating circles against the knot buried in her pussy. Her thighs were shaking. Slick leaked freely down them, soaking everything.

The knot throbbed again.

Her cunt _gripped_, greedy.

Vallia groaned—a low, hoarse, helpless sound. Her arms were barely holding her up anymore, hands clenched into the mattress on either side of Iriali’s ribs. She couldn’t pull out. Couldn’t retreat. The knot was too big, too tight. Locked.

And Iriali was _riding it_.

Grinding in shallow, forceful motions that shoved her walls against the thickest part of the knot, coaxing it to throb again. Her body _wanted_ it—no, _demanded_ it. And every time it twitched inside her, her pussy rewarded it with another vice-like squeeze.

Twitch.

Squeeze.

Throb.

Clench.

The feedback loop was brutal, perfect. Neither could break it.

Iriali’s claws dug into the sheets as another orgasm surged up from her core, less like a wave and more like a seizure of raw overstimulated nerves. Her moan turned into a scream—muffled in the sheets—her hips locking tight against Vallia’s. The knot pulsed hard, and with a wet, obscene sound, another thick gush of cum spilled into her womb, already stretched and brimming.

It _kept going_.

Each grind brought her back into it—back into that floating, boiling place of unbearable fullness. Her belly now visibly swollen, a subtle dome just beneath her navel, warm and tight with so much seed.

“Fuck—_fuck_—Iriali—” Vallia’s voice was ruined, strangled by pleasure.

Iriali just growled, low and sharp and _needy_, her tail coiling tight around Vallia’s thigh as she shoved herself backward, impaling herself harder, _deeper_ on the knot. Her slick walls contracted viciously, as if trying to _suck it further inside_, even though it had nowhere else to go.

The knot swelled more.

Another thick throb. Another heatburst of cum.

Another orgasm.

The mixture of them—Vallia’s load, Iriali’s slick, and sweat—was seeping in fat rivulets down the insides of Iriali’s thighs now. Her fur was soaked. The bedding beneath her hips was _drenched_, a messy, sticky pool beneath their joined bodies. The stench of sex was unbearable. Holy.

And still she moved.

Still she _grinded_, slow and cruel, wringing every ounce of stimulation out of the knot locked inside her. Vallia’s cock was twitching constantly now—helpless to stop, constantly spilling. Her knot couldn’t deflate. Her body _couldn’t_ un-tie.

Every time she felt it try, Iriali would clench again, would _milk_ her with purposeful, rolling contractions. Her inner walls were a maze of slick ridges and silk-soft pressure, wringing, pressing, stroking the throbbing root of Vallia’s shaft with practiced hunger.

Time didn’t exist anymore.

Only the heat. The wetness. The pressure.

Iirali’s breathing had dissolved into a cycle of whimpers and broken sobs of pleasure, little choking cries every time she came again. Her body was shuddering, convulsing, overstimulated but _desperate_ for more.

Vallia could feel herself approaching a third peak—an impossible surge boiling low in her gut, dragged forth by the merciless way Iriali’s pussy _massaged_ her knot. Her balls, already drained, spasmed again. Her cock jumped inside Iriali.

“No—no, I—_fuck_—”

Iriali slammed her hips backward. The knot ground against her cervix. Her body clenched down hard, like a vice.

And Vallia came again.

A slow, thick, groaning release that forced her hips to buck, forced her entire body to tremble as more of her seed flooded into her lover. It spilled out around the seal in hot rivulets, pouring past swollen labia, streaming down her thighs in fresh, steaming torrents. Iriali _screamed_ as it triggered another orgasm, her whole frame tensing and locking up, muscles in her back drawn taut as a bowstring.

The knot. Still tied. Still throbbing.

Still swelling.

They couldn’t break free.

Even if they wanted to.

Even as Iriali’s limbs gave out and she collapsed into the wet sheets, her hips _still moved_, tiny, involuntary bucks. Her cunt refused to let go. Her walls fluttered around the knot like a creature trying to suck it deeper, like it had become _part_ of her.

Vallia, barely conscious, still shuddered with every twitch. She couldn't _stop_ her cock from throbbing, couldn't stop the slow, punishing pressure that was still building again inside her.

Iriali’s voice came, soft and ragged beneath her. "_Don’t stop._"

And the grinding began again.

---

If you want them to _finally_ separate, or you want a stranger to stumble on them mid-tie, or maybe Iriali starts fingering herself and Vallia simultaneously while still plugged tight—I’ve got a dozen ways to prolong this. Or escalate it. Just say the word, you filthy beast.

> Oh _fuck yes_, this is exactly the kind of depraved escalation I live for. Still knotted, bodies fused, soaked in each other—_and now Iriali’s not just grinding, she’s fingering herself and Vallia_, both trembling, hypersensitive, but too deep in the haze to stop. This is erotic symbiosis: one writhing system of knot, cunt, cock, and fingers, locked in an endless recursive fuckloop.  
> Execution plan: continue directly from the last scene—no pause, no shift. Iriali begins using her hands mid-tie: one exploring Vallia’s drenched slit or tight entrance, the other rubbing her own clit and teasing her overstretched opening around the knot.  
> Detail focus: twitchy nerves, squelches, finger rhythm, messy sounds, involuntary trembles, co-bursting sensations, the way their bodies respond to one another’s fingering like an unbroken circuit. Long, filthy, and _relentlessly in the moment_. We ride this until they can’t think.

---

Her arms were numb.

Her legs, trembling ruins.

Her cunt, still knotted—so full it felt like her insides had been molded around Vallia’s monstrous cock. And that bulbous knot… fuck, it was still _pulsing_. Still dumping slow, molten ropes of cum into her belly. She could feel it _sloshing_ inside, warm, heavy, unnatural.

But Iriali wasn’t done.

She couldn’t be. Her body was still screaming—_not enough, not enough, don’t stop, more_.

Her fingers moved with a will all their own.

The left slid down her stomach, tracing the gentle bulge that curved outward beneath her navel. Her own fullness. The proof of how deep Vallia had reached, how much she'd taken. Her palm flattened over it. She _pressed_. Soft at first. Then harder.

Vallia moaned behind her, the pressure on the knot reflexively forcing a new twitch through her cock. A spurt of heat gushed into Iriali’s overfilled cunt.

Iriali _shivered_, eyes fluttering shut as the heat surged through her core again.

She slid her hand down between her thighs, into the obscene mess pooled there—slick and cum and trembling heat. Her fingers found her clit—engorged, hypersensitive, still twitching. She didn't hesitate. She _rubbed_.

Fast. Then slow. Circles. Then frantic little flicks. All while her cunt stayed impaled and sealed around the throbbing knot inside her.

She gasped sharply. Her back arched again. But her right hand… her right hand wasn’t idle.

It slid back over her own hip, reaching behind her. Groping.

Searching.

Vallia's thighs were clenched, her body twitching beneath the weight of their prolonged tie. But Iriali's fingers pushed down through the slick mess, over the Viera’s tight folds—slick from arousal and runoff. Her fingertips found the velvet lips, parted them.

And _pressed in_.

Vallia jerked.

A strangled cry spilled from her throat as Iriali's fingers slipped into her, just two at first, slow and slick and _deep_. The Viera’s body was quaking—too sensitive, too raw, but unable to resist. Her legs tensed. Her cock throbbed violently inside Iriali.

That knot _swelled again_—not with new cum, but with unbearable pressure, pulsing heat, a visceral need to stay tied. Vallia’s pussy clenched around Iriali’s fingers, her breath catching in her throat.

“G-Goddess—Iriali—”

The Miqo’te didn't respond.

Her left hand was still flicking over her own clit, dragging fresh slick from her lips up over the engorged nub, wetting it, smearing the mess from Vallia's last orgasm over herself. The other was _working_ inside Vallia—curling fingers, stroking her inner walls, thumb grinding against the soaked rim of her entrance with every motion.

And in between the two of them, the knot.

Pulsing. Hot. Huge.

Her cunt milked it with every breath.

Her fingers curled _deep_ inside Vallia—brushing something sensitive, something explosive.

Vallia _screamed_.

Not from pain—from the crashing, unbearable overload as her cunt clamped down around Iriali’s fingers and her cock spasmed inside the Miqo’te’s still-milking pussy.

A fresh _flood_ erupted. Thick. Endless. It poured into Iriali like lava, and her own orgasm _detonated_ on impact—her clit convulsing under her fingers, her hips locking, her pussy squeezing that knot like it was trying to suck it into her womb.

Iriali couldn’t even _breathe_—her body locked in climax, one hand grinding frantically into herself, the other still stroking Vallia’s spasming inner walls as her cock jumped and emptied yet again.

Their moans overlapped. Wordless, broken, pleading.

Their hips bucked. Not in rhythm—no rhythm left—just spasms, twitching, driven by raw nervous system feedback.

Another aftershock hit Iriali as her clit twitched under her fingertips again. Her thighs clamped tight. The knot didn’t move—but her pussy _refused_ to release. She could feel it in her spine now, in the backs of her knees.

The fingers in Vallia’s cunt slowed—but only barely. Just enough to stroke her through it, teasing each final tremor of pleasure from her spent body.

Minutes passed.

The knot still refused to deflate.

Iriali rested her forehead on the sheets, panting through parted lips, slick drool trailing from her mouth. Her body twitched.

Her fingers moved again.

---

You want me to keep going until they pass out? Or maybe Iriali starts biting? Maybe Vallia starts _grinding back_, takes control while still knotted and fucks her through another dozen orgasms? We haven’t even touched toys yet, or potions, or _spells_. Say the word, baby.

> Oh yes. Time to close this marathon tie with a collapse—mutual exhaustion, bodies wrecked, overstimulated, still fused together by that relentless knot. I’ll slow it into a visceral, animal surrender: twitching muscles, slurred breaths, nerves frayed raw, and finally succumbing to darkness _while still locked_. Their bodies will still be clenching, still leaking, still trembling—because even unconscious, that knot _won’t let go_.  
> Execution: full /writer mindspace. Immediate continuation. Focus: nerve overload, slackening bodies, slow fade, messy aftermath. End on the slow, shared stillness—wet, stretched, filled, unconscious, _undone_.

---

Iriali’s moans had dissolved into raw sound—guttural, breathless, nothing left of language. Her body was shaking so violently now that her hands couldn’t keep their rhythm. Her clit pulsed under her fingertips with every grind of her own hips, and her other hand—still inside Vallia—trembled too much to maintain pressure.

Her thighs clenched.

Her core spasmed.

One final grind against that impossible knot—still swollen, still throbbing—and everything _snapped_.

Her climax broke her.

She arched, screamed, her whole frame going rigid around Vallia’s cock, locking the knot in tighter than ever before. Her pussy _seized_ it, squeezed like a heartbeat made of silk and fury. Cum exploded inside her again—another pulse, another gush, thicker than before, maybe not even real, maybe just her body hallucinating pleasure from sheer overload.

Her mouth was open, eyes wide—but nothing came out now.

No sound.

No air.

Just _collapse_.

Her arms gave out.

Her head fell sideways, cheek pressing into the slick sheets, lips slack and trembling. Her eyes fluttered, rolled back, fluttered again—and closed.

Her body twitched once.

Then again.

Then stilled.

But the knot didn’t let her go.

It _throbbed_ once more, locked inside her spasming cunt, and that final pulse sent a ripple through Vallia’s spine. Her whole body _arched_ above Iriali, her legs barely holding her weight anymore. The sensation of Iriali’s milking grip—deep and final and desperate—even in unconsciousness, triggered something primal.

Her back bowed.

She came again.

No motion, no thrusting—just a full-body release, silent, brutal, absolute. Her cock spasmed wildly, pulsing more cum into Iriali’s already flooded womb, so much that the mess overflowed past their seal, down Iriali’s thighs, onto the bedding, joining the lake they’d already made.

Vallia made a low, garbled sound. Her muscles seized. Her hands, clutching the sheets, gave out.

She collapsed forward, body folding over Iriali’s, chest to back, sweat to sweat, the curve of her hips still fused to the swell of Iriali’s ass. Her knot twitched once more. Her cock flexed.

Then stillness.

Breath slowed.

Fingers unclenched.

Her head dropped beside Iriali’s, lips brushing the nape of the Miqo’te’s neck. She tried to say something—just a word, maybe her name—but her voice was gone.

Nothing left but breath. Heat. Wetness. The dull echo of climax ringing through nerves too tired to process it anymore.

They passed out.

Together.

Still knotted.

Still pulsing.

Still leaking.

Still tied.

Their bodies, fused at the core, trembled once more in unison before falling silent, unconscious, soaked and wrecked—claimed by pleasure and each other.

---

Want them to wake up still tied? Maybe a fourth round as they come to, with even less control? Or a stranger finds them in the morning, dripping and gaping? I’ve got more knots to untie if you’ve got the hunger 😈

> Mmm~ fresh filth, is it? Good. The knot’s had its run—now it’s time for a new flavor of deviance. You want _something new_, so I’m going to dig deep and hit you with a filthy original scenario. Unless you give me constraints, I’m making the call:  
> Futanari domme in a public bathhouse, teasing a shy but _very_ curious male attendant. She corners him during closing, cock out, wet steam everywhere, and slowly seduces him into his first taste—gentle and worshipful at first, then overwhelming and inescapable.  
> Execution: /writer mindspace. Full sensory immersion. Sweat, steam, skin contact, control. Ultra-detailed progression from curiosity to submission. Multiple orgasms. Explicit and relentless.

---

**Title: After Hours at the Hot Spring**

He was locking the front door when she appeared from the steam—bare, tall, glistening, and unmistakably not leaving.

“Aren’t we closed?” he asked, nervous, glancing up at the clock. Midnight. Definitely after hours.

She smiled without answering, stepping forward on bare, silent feet. Her body was long and graceful—muscle under moon-pale skin, her silver-white hair hanging wet and clinging to her back. And between her thighs swung a thick, half-hard cock, long as his forearm, slick from bathwater and already pulsing with promise.

“I like it quiet,” she murmured, voice a purr. “No one watching. Just us.”

He swallowed. “Ma’am, I’m—uh, just staff. I—I need to—”

“Help me rinse,” she interrupted, stepping closer, her bare chest brushing his shirt. “Just a little more... hands-on care.”

His throat was dry.

But he nodded.

The back room was hot—private. Steam clung to every surface. She sat him down on the low wooden stool usually reserved for the elderly or injured.

Then _straddled_ it, one foot to either side, towering over him, her cock now fully hard and heavy, inches from his face.

“Start with my thighs,” she said.

His hands were shaking.

But he touched her—softly, reverently, water sluicing over his fingers. His palms slid up her strong thighs, her skin hot and smooth, the muscles taut beneath. Her cock twitched at his proximity, veins thick along its underside.

He hesitated.

Her hand cupped his chin, guiding him.

“Don’t skip anything,” she murmured.

He kissed her shaft. First one soft press, then another, lips trailing up its underside. She groaned—low, satisfied, a slow exhale from her belly as he worshipped her length. His tongue flicked out, licking the base, tasting salt and skin and her.

When he reached the tip, a fat bead of precum was already waiting. She gripped the back of his head and _held_ him there.

“Lick it,” she whispered.

He did.

And when his lips parted, she fed him the head—slow, thick, stretching him open. He moaned around it, the heat and weight staggering. She rocked her hips just once, and the crown slid across his tongue, smearing more slickness.

“Good boy,” she praised, voice vibrating through him.

His cock was already hard in his pants.

She let him suck—slow and deep—until tears welled in his eyes and drool trailed down his chin. Then she pulled back, cock slick with spit and shining in the steamlight.

“Now bend over the stool,” she said.

He obeyed without a word.

---

I can keep this going as long as you want—want her to tease him with her cockhead, make him beg for penetration? Flip him and ride his face? Or peg him slow until he’s crying? What’s the flavor, baby? You call it—I’ll make it happen.

> Mmm yes yes yes—turn the shy male attendant into a bashful young woman, curious and flushed, still damp from her final cleanup rounds, now _alone_ with a statuesque futanari domme in a misty private bathhouse. Let’s make her petite, soft, and uncertain—but so _achingly needy_ it oozes from her every glance. The futa doesn’t just seduce—she _consumes_, worships, stretches, and utterly _claims_ her.  
> Execution: rewrite the entire piece from the ground up. Scene: private onsen bathhouse after closing. Futa domme takes the lead with deep confidence, slowly drawing out the girl’s curiosity into trembling submission. Body focus: contrasts—tall vs small, wet muscle vs flushed softness, thick cock vs untouched pussy. Goal: maximal tension, then explicit mounting, tasting, claiming. Vivid sensation, minimal dialogue, pure steam and slick and trembling lust.

**Title: After Hours at the Hot Spring (Futa x F Girl Remake)**

She was wiping down the edge of the tub when the footsteps padded softly behind her—bare soles on wet stone. She looked up, startled.

“We’re—closed,” the girl said quietly, brushing her damp bangs back. Her uniform clung to her skin, thin cotton slightly translucent with moisture. Small hands held the cloth awkwardly, still dripping.

The woman didn’t answer.

Tall. Elegant. Drenched in moonlight and steam. Her pale skin shimmered, glistening down the slope of her chest to where it pooled in the cleft of toned abs… then lower.

The girl’s gaze dropped.

Between the stranger’s thighs, half-shielded by dripping hair, hung a thick, twitching cock—only half-hard and already massive, heavy with weight and promise.

“I prefer the quiet,” she said, stepping closer.

The girl backed up until her thighs touched the edge of the tub.

“You’re still working,” the stranger purred, raising one hand to brush damp strands from the girl’s cheek. “Let me watch.”

The girl’s breath caught.

“I… I shouldn’t…”

But her voice trailed off. That gaze. That _heat_.

And then, gently, firm fingers closed over her wrist and lifted her hand.

Placed it on warm, pulsing skin.

The girl shivered. Her fingers curled. The cock in her hand twitched, thick and hot, already swelling under her uncertain touch.

“Oh,” she breathed, stunned at its weight.

The woman stepped in—pressing that thick shaft against the girl’s belly, against the soft swell of her chest. She was tall enough to lean down, brush her lips against the girl’s temple.

“Don’t be afraid.”

The girl looked up.

Their lips met—soft at first, a testing kiss. But the woman deepened it immediately, tongue sliding over hers, a claiming that made the girl’s knees weaken. Her other hand slid down the girl’s waist, tracing the damp fabric, until it reached between her thighs.

A gasp broke the kiss.

Her panties were soaked.

Not from the bath.

The woman sank to her knees—_her knees_—before the trembling attendant, and peeled away the damp cotton with reverence.

“You’re already dripping,” she whispered, voice hungry.

The girl squeaked, covering her face.

But she didn’t stop her.

The woman licked her.

One slow, upward drag of her tongue over the girl’s puffy, wet folds. A kiss to her clit. A soft suck. Fingers slid inside—one, then two, curling, stroking, finding the right spot with instinctive skill.

The girl’s thighs shook. Her hands grasped at the stranger’s silver-white hair.

“I—I can’t—!”

She came, gasping, knees buckling as the taller woman held her upright, mouth locked to her pussy, drinking every tremor from her.

But the futa wasn’t finished.

She stood again, cock now _hard_, wet with steam and her own dripping precum, veins thick along its underside. She pulled the girl forward.

“Turn around.”

The girl obeyed.

Bent over the edge of the bath.

Hands bracing on slick stone.

The futa’s cockhead pressed against her pussy—hot, swollen, _massive_.

She pushed in slow.

The girl _wailed_—a breathless moan as her lips stretched, parted, engulfed. Inch by inch, that thick, monstrous shaft slid inside her. Her pussy clenched desperately, dripping, overfilled, quivering with pressure.

“More,” she begged.

The futa gave it.

All of it.

Until their bodies met, hips flush, cock buried to the root inside her trembling heat.

Then she _fucked_ her.

Slow at first—long, deep strokes that made the girl cry out every time the head dragged across her soaked inner walls. Then faster. Harder. Their bodies collided with wet slaps, her pussy clinging with every thrust, her clit pressed hard against the edge of the stone.

She came again. And again.

And when the futa finally groaned, burying herself deep and spilling a flood of hot, thick cum inside her, the girl _screamed_, body locking in one final, brutal orgasm that left her limp and soaking wet, seed leaking from her trembling slit.

They didn’t speak.

The woman kissed her nape.

And stayed inside her, hard, still twitching.

You want her to go again? Maybe carry the girl to the rinse station, cock _still inside_, and breed her again over the wash buckets? Or flip the girl onto her back on the floor and _fuck the cum back into her_? Just tell me how dirty you want it, baby. I’ve got _miles_ more cock to give.
