# Here We Go Again

Title: Here We Go Again


The abbey stood at the edge of the highland woods, its spires reaching modestly into a sky the color of old parchment. Evening had fallen gently, not with drama but with the subtle confidence of a place that had seen centuries pass like the slow turning of pages. Bells no longer rang in the halls — not since the sisters took their final vows of silence — but something deeper than sound still echoed there. A kind of stillness that knew things.

Iriali had not meant to stay long.

She had arrived days earlier with dust on her boots and a story she refused to tell, offering coin she could barely spare for a place to rest and recover. Her hair, platinum-blonde and unruly from the road, had drawn stares. So had her curvaceous figure, her sharp eyes, her warm and easy smile. But the sisters accepted all, and they had given her a room, food, and quiet.

It was the quiet that had unnerved her most.

Now, with the sun dipping low and shadows stretching like fingers through the cloister halls, Iriali wandered barefoot through the old stone corridors. Her robe — on loan — was soft and thin, the fabric whispering at her thighs with each step. Her body ached pleasantly from the baths, from rest, from stillness.

And from watching her.

She hadn’t known her name at first. Just the shape of her — tall, broad-shouldered, long-legged — and the way she moved. Not like the sisters, not soft and devout. This one moved like a blade in slow wind: precise, effortless, dangerous only if you were foolish enough to ignore her.

Later, she’d heard the name in passing. Vallia.

Iriali had whispered it to herself a few times since. Vallia. A name with bite. A name that fit.

She was a resident here, not a sister, not quite. She trained the abbey guard, helped manage the stores. She rarely spoke, but when she did, her voice was low and smooth like oiled leather, edged with something wild. Iriali hadn’t needed words from her.

She felt her.

In every glance from across the courtyard. In every passing moment when their shoulders brushed. In the way Vallia’s violet-blue eyes lingered just a heartbeat too long. In the heat that coiled low in Iriali’s belly each time it happened.

Tonight, the corridors were empty. The last of the daylight had fled, leaving only the warm flicker of torch sconces and the smell of old stone and pressed lavender. Iriali paused beside an arched window, the breeze lifting the ends of her hair, cooling the heat rising just beneath her skin.

She was not alone.

The sensation hit her like breath across the nape of her neck. Not sound — not even a footstep — but presence. Weight.

She turned.

Vallia stood at the far end of the corridor, one shoulder braced casually against a pillar, arms folded. She wore no armor, only a belted robe similar to Iriali’s — though it clung differently to her body, shaped by strength rather than softness. Her long, black hair was damp from the bathhouse, curling at the ends.

The torchlight lit one side of her face, catching the edge of a smirk.

Iriali said nothing.

She didn’t have to.

She stepped forward. Slowly. Not like prey, but like someone approaching a cliff and deciding not to stop. Vallia remained still until Iriali was nearly in reach, her height forcing Iriali to tilt her head to meet her gaze.

“Are you following me?” Iriali asked, voice quiet.

“Are you walking where I already planned to be?” Vallia replied, voice equally low.

Iriali’s smile was small but real. She didn’t step back. She didn’t break the gaze.

“I thought you didn’t talk.”

“I don’t. Unless I want something.”

A beat.

“Do you want something now?”

Vallia’s eyes searched hers. Not hungrily — not yet — but with a weight that made Iriali’s stomach tighten. Then she raised one hand and brushed a strand of Iriali’s hair behind her ear.

“I want to know what you feel like when you stop pretending you’re not curious.”

Iriali’s breath caught. Then she let it go in a slow exhale.

She stepped forward, closing the final inches between them.

Their bodies didn’t touch — not yet. But the heat between them did. It pulsed like a heartbeat.

“I’m not pretending,” Iriali whispered. “I just don’t know what I’m allowed to feel here.”

Vallia leaned down until their lips nearly touched, her breath warm and steady. “Everything.”

That was enough.

Iriali kissed her.


The kiss began with restraint — a brush of mouths, tentative, exploratory — but restraint was not something either of them wore well for long.

Vallia moved first, tilting her head, deepening the contact with the kind of confidence that came from knowing her strength and holding it back. Her hand found the back of Iriali’s neck, fingers spreading wide, warm and firm. Iriali responded with a low, involuntary sound — not quite a sigh, not quite a moan — something shaped by months of wondering and days of watching.

Their robes became the second lie to fall away.

Vallia’s came first. She reached for the belt without breaking the kiss, fingers tugging once, then letting the fabric fall open. Iriali’s hands followed, sliding beneath the loosened folds, palms mapping the hard line of muscle beneath the soft robe. Her fingers brushed the edge of a sheath — warm, furred, not quite human — and she paused just long enough for Vallia’s breath to hitch.

“You’re not surprised,” Vallia murmured.

“No,” Iriali whispered, smiling against her throat. “I’m curious.”

She sank to her knees.

The corridor was still lit with firelight, though the flicker had dimmed as torches burned low. Iriali pressed kisses to Vallia’s thighs — thick and plush, muscled beneath their softness — tasting the salt of clean skin. She nuzzled lower, drawn not just by anatomy but by the sound of Vallia’s breathing, the subtle tensing of her legs, the way her weight shifted forward without command.

Vallia’s cock was already emerging from its sheath, thick and glossy, the head a dusky pink that flushed deeper as it grew. Iriali watched it swell, not just with lust but with awe, her fingers brushing along its length, trailing to the forming knot below. It was beautiful — alien and familiar all at once — and she leaned in to taste.

The first lick was slow. Deliberate. Vallia groaned, low and brief, her hand tightening in Iriali’s hair.

She licked again, circling the head, then drew it into her mouth — not all at once, but with intent. Her lips stretched around the girth, her tongue pressed flat beneath. She felt the throb, the flex, the way Vallia shuddered under the weight of restraint. Iriali bobbed slowly, teasing, her hand stroking the base in rhythm, cupping the bulge of the knot as it swelled beneath her palm.

“You’re playing with fire,” Vallia murmured.

Iriali pulled back just far enough to speak, lips wet, eyes wicked. “You look like you can take the heat.”

Vallia pulled her up by the shoulders in one smooth motion. Iriali laughed — breathless, aroused, delighted — and let herself be pinned against the nearest pillar. Vallia kissed her again, harder this time, tongue deep, hands gripping her waist.

The robe was gone in seconds.

Iriali’s body was warm and inviting, her tan-gray skin flushed, her curves lush and yielding. Vallia ran her hands over her, pausing to knead the full swell of her breasts, to trail down the dip of her waist, to squeeze the softness of her thighs. Her mouth found Iriali’s neck, then her chest, then lower.

By the time she reached her knees, Iriali was already dripping.

Vallia didn’t tease. She licked with purpose — slow, steady, precise. Iriali’s fingers dug into her hair, hips rolling in search of more. She moaned aloud now, no longer shy, no longer pretending she hadn’t dreamed of this.

The corridor air smelled of them — sweat and want and skin.

Vallia stood. Her cock was flushed and twitching, knot swollen near full. Iriali reached for it, but Vallia caught her wrists and pinned them gently against the stone.

“No more teasing,” she said.

“Then take me.”

Vallia lifted her.

It was a show of strength more than effort — Iriali was light in her arms, thighs wrapped around Vallia’s waist, slick heat pressed against her cock. Vallia positioned herself with care, letting the head rest against her folds, rubbing gently, coating herself.

Iriali’s eyes fluttered.

“Now,” she whispered.

Vallia pushed in.

The breath left Iriali’s lungs in a sharp cry, not from pain but from the intensity of stretch, the sheer girth of her lover pressing into her inch by inch. Her walls clenched instinctively, her body opening in waves. She threw her head back, gasping, while Vallia groaned into her shoulder.

They stayed like that — joined, unmoving — for a moment that stretched long and hot and holy.

Then Vallia began to move.


Iriali’s breath came in broken little gasps as Vallia filled her. She could feel every inch — the stretch, the pressure, the heat of it — as if her body were waking up for the first time. The thick flare of Vallia’s head dragged along nerves too long left untouched, and the slow, deliberate rocking made her whimper against the column.

Vallia’s hands steadied her hips, but her mouth was anything but composed. She kissed whatever skin she could reach — Iriali’s throat, her shoulder, the edge of her collarbone. She murmured things between kisses, not full words but sounds that held meaning: hunger, reverence, restraint threatening to unravel.

The motion built gradually.

Vallia rolled her hips in smooth, unhurried circles. She wasn’t thrusting yet — not really — just rocking enough to make Iriali squirm, to make her body flutter with need. The ridge of her cock dragged deliciously across swollen walls, coaxing slick from deep inside. Her knot, fully formed now, pressed insistently against Iriali’s entrance, not forcing, just... suggesting.

Iriali writhed.

“Don’t tease,” she hissed, her voice cracking with desire.

“You said you were curious,” Vallia answered, her mouth ghosting over Iriali’s ear. “I’m letting you learn.”

She pressed again — the knot a thick, rounded pressure at her opening. Iriali bit her lip and tilted her hips down, grinding against it.

Her body resisted. Just slightly. But she was so wet now, so open.

Vallia groaned low in her throat and pushed a little harder.

Iriali cried out — not in pain, but surprise — as her body finally gave way, sucking the knot inside in a hot, wet clench. Her eyes fluttered. Her legs trembled.

“Oh gods,” she gasped.

Vallia held her close, still buried deep, breathing hard against her neck.

“That’s it,” she whispered. “You’re mine now.”

Iriali could only nod — trembling, filled, completely full — her heartbeat echoing the rhythm of their bodies, the tension barely held in check before the storm of release.


The world narrowed to breath and muscle, pulse and pressure.

Vallia held her steady, one arm braced under Iriali’s thigh, the other curled around her lower back, keeping her upright and open and entirely hers. The knot locked them together now, swelling even further inside her, each shift of their hips sending a ripple of sensation up Iriali’s spine. She whimpered into Vallia’s shoulder, teeth grazing her skin, her fingers clawing for something to hold on to that wasn’t just heat and air and trembling flesh.

Vallia began to move again, this time with true intent.

It wasn’t fast. It couldn’t be — not with the knot nestled tight, not with Iriali still fluttering around her, moaning like a girl drunk on pleasure. But it was deep. Slow, dragging thrusts that pushed and pulled with aching intensity, making Iriali feel the entire length of her over and over again.

Her legs wrapped tighter around Vallia’s waist. Her body clenched and released, helpless to resist the rhythm. She had never felt so full. So split open and claimed and alive. Every nerve was lit with sensation. Every breath came as a gasp.

“You feel...” Vallia began, voice rough in her throat, “...so damn perfect.”

Iriali couldn’t answer. Her mind was white-hot and empty, her world reduced to sensation and sound: the wet slap of skin, the low grind of hips, the shared moans echoing through the corridor like prayer.

Vallia drove her higher.

Each motion sent a jolt through her, building pressure low in her belly. It spiraled up her spine, tight and wild and impossible to contain. Her nails raked across Vallia’s back, her cries turning into sharp, breathless pleas.

“Please,” she gasped. “Don’t stop. Gods, don’t stop—”

“I won’t,” Vallia growled, her voice breaking. “You’re not ready to come yet.”

Iriali sobbed — half-desperate, half-wanting — as Vallia ground in deeper, her knot hitting something that made her vision blur.

The tension snapped.

Iriali came with a cry that echoed like thunder through the stone hall. Her body seized around Vallia, every muscle clenching in a rolling, crashing wave. Her thighs shook. Her head fell back. She was undone.

But Vallia wasn’t finished.

The tight, pulsing squeeze of Iriali’s climax triggered her own, deep and visceral. She pressed in one final time, hips locked tight, the knot fully swollen and sealed inside. She groaned — loud and low — and came in thick, hot bursts, flooding Iriali with a heat she could feel blooming deep inside.

They clung to each other, locked and panting, bodies trembling from the violence of pleasure.

Minutes passed.

Iriali could feel the aftershocks still rolling through her — little pulses of sensation, fluttering twitches where they remained joined. Her body ached in the best way, and the fullness of Vallia’s knot kept her stretched, claimed, impossibly aware of every shift and breath.

She buried her face in Vallia’s neck.

“That,” she murmured, voice hoarse, “was not what I expected from a silent abbey.”

Vallia chuckled, a soft rumble in her chest. “Neither was you.”

She bent to kiss her, softer now, tasting sweat and intimacy and something that might have been affection. Iriali melted into it.

Eventually, Vallia moved — carefully, gently — carrying Iriali still locked around her down the corridor, through a private side door and into the quiet warmth of her quarters.

She laid her down on a low bed, cradled her as her knot remained firmly in place, stroking her hip in slow, lazy circles.

Iriali reached up and brushed a damp lock of hair from Vallia’s cheek.

“So,” she whispered, “does this mean I’m staying a little longer?”

Vallia’s eyes crinkled with something like a smile.

“You’re not going anywhere tonight.”

And neither of them wanted to.


Vallia’s climax wasn’t a single burst — it came in waves, each one crashing harder than the last, her body caught in a rhythm that went beyond conscious movement. Her hips bucked despite the knot locking her in place, each pulse of heat buried deeper, her seed spilling into Iriali with a fullness that made the younger woman tremble all over again.

Iriali moaned helplessly as she felt it. Her body responded with its own aftershocks, internal muscles fluttering around the knot as if trying to milk every drop from her lover. The sensation was overwhelming — not just the stretch and fullness, but the connection, the absolute impossibility of separating one body from the other in that moment.

They were fused, and it felt right.

Vallia gritted her teeth, her arms shaking with the effort of holding Iriali upright. Her lips found the curve of Iriali’s shoulder again, pressing kiss after kiss to sweat-slick skin, wordless and reverent.

Iriali clung to her, still coming down from the high, still panting like she’d run a great distance, her thighs twitching from exertion. Her head rested against Vallia’s shoulder, her eyes closed, breath warm against the warrior’s neck.

“Still think I was just curious?” she murmured, voice thick with exhaustion and awe.

Vallia huffed a breath, almost a laugh. “No. That wasn’t curiosity. That was hunger.”

Iriali smiled lazily. “Then what was yours?”

Vallia shifted her weight, carefully adjusting her hold without tugging at the knot. “Mine?” She looked down, her gaze unguarded for the first time. “Desire. For something I didn’t think I’d ever want.”

Iriali tilted her head back, blinking up at her. “Me?”

Vallia nodded.

The admission hung between them, heavy and raw. No ceremony, no pretense.

Just truth.

Vallia took a careful step back and braced them both against the pillar again. She didn’t pull out — couldn’t, even if she’d wanted to — but she let her hands wander across Iriali’s back, soothing the tremble from her limbs.

“You okay?” she asked softly.

Iriali breathed in deep, then exhaled against her. “I don’t think I’ll be able to walk tomorrow.”

“Good.”

“Gods,” Iriali chuckled, “you are dangerous.”

“And you didn’t run.”

“I wanted to,” she whispered, her tone gentler now. “But then you looked at me.”

Vallia stroked her side. “Like you were worth stopping for?”

“Exactly like that.”

They stayed there like that for what felt like forever — warm and still and filled to overflowing. Neither of them spoke, but their hands kept moving, exploring, learning without urgency. Iriali traced the line of Vallia’s spine. Vallia combed fingers through Iriali’s damp, tangled hair.

Eventually, Vallia leaned back against the stone and lowered herself slowly, carefully, until she was sitting with Iriali in her lap, still connected, the knot holding them close.

Iriali curled into her, limbs draped over muscular shoulders, her robe half-forgotten somewhere on the corridor floor.

She glanced up. “Does this make us a scandal?”

“In the abbey?” Vallia smiled faintly. “No more than usual.”

Iriali laughed softly and rested her head against her chest, lulled by the steady beat of Vallia’s heart.

Time passed. The knot would hold them for a while still.

Neither of them minded.


It took time for their bodies to settle.

Vallia’s breathing slowed first, the force of climax leaving her boneless but aware. She let herself lean back against the cool stone, Iriali still curled against her like something precious. The knot pulsed gently with each heartbeat, a living reminder of what they’d just done — and what they couldn’t undo even if they tried.

Iriali stirred, not from discomfort, but from the lingering hum of arousal that hadn’t fully ebbed.

“You’re still hard,” she whispered, glancing down with flushed cheeks.

Vallia gave a lazy, satisfied smile. “Not for long. That’s just the knot doing its work.”

Iriali rocked her hips forward experimentally, and they both shivered at the sensation.

“You mean keeping me full?”

Vallia didn’t reply with words — she simply nuzzled her throat and hummed her agreement. The quiet sound vibrated through Iriali’s chest.

A soft laugh bubbled up between them.

It wasn’t giggling, not exactly — something deeper, more intimate. The kind of laugh lovers shared when they knew they’d both just crossed a line they weren’t planning to retreat from.

Iriali’s fingers traced along Vallia’s chest, circling the edge of a faint scar, then traveling lower until she was cupping the curve of her belly, where she could feel the flutter of her own heartbeat echoing through both of them.

“There’s so much of you in me,” she whispered, in awe.

Vallia’s voice was low. “I know.”

A pause.

Iriali blinked, her lashes brushing Vallia’s skin. “I like it.”

That broke something soft in Vallia’s chest.

She gathered Iriali closer and kissed her temple — a gentle, reverent thing — not born of lust, but of the quiet after. The warmth of something new blooming between them, just as real as the ache still throbbing between Iriali’s legs.

“You’re not like anyone I’ve known,” Vallia said.

“I hope not,” Iriali teased, but her voice trembled with sincerity.

“I don’t mean it as a compliment,” Vallia replied, but the smirk gave her away.

Iriali pinched her side playfully. “Ass.”

“You love it.”

“I might,” she admitted. “But only if you help me walk back to my room after your knot goes down.”

Vallia ran a hand down Iriali’s back. “We’ll see.”

They stayed like that, bare and tangled, warm and spent, until the knot began to soften. Even then, neither moved quickly. There was no shame, no need to retreat into silence.

What they’d shared wasn’t a mistake. It was something real — strange, sweet, and undeniable.


When Vallia finally withdrew, it was with a care so tender that Iriali almost didn’t feel it — except for the emptiness it left behind.

The knot had softened enough to slip free, aided by a shift of Iriali’s hips and a soft exhale from both of them. A wet sound marked their parting, followed by a slow, steady seep of warmth between Iriali’s thighs. She hissed at the sensation, blinking up at Vallia with a flush that spoke of embarrassment and contentment all at once.

“Sorry,” she whispered, shifting self-consciously.

Vallia leaned in and kissed her forehead. “Don’t apologize for being claimed.”

Iriali stared at her, lips parted. Her heart thumped at the word — claimed — like it unlocked something deep in her chest.

She looked away, swallowing. “That’s...a lot.”

Vallia tilted her chin back. “Too much?”

Iriali didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she slid her arms around Vallia’s neck, hugging her close. Her voice, when it came, was quiet and certain.

“No. Just real.”

They sat together in silence, Iriali perched in Vallia’s lap, both of them bare and boneless. Somewhere beyond the stone corridor, the abbey stirred — soft bells, muted footsteps, the start of another early morning prayer cycle.

Neither of them moved.

Eventually, Vallia rose, cradling Iriali against her chest, and carried her into her quarters — a spartan room tucked into the lower cloister. It was dimly lit and smelled faintly of cedar, with thick wool blankets folded neatly at the foot of the bed. Vallia laid her down gently, then crawled in beside her, pulling the covers up and wrapping one arm around her waist.

Iriali curled into the warmth with a soft sigh.

“Do you always bring strange girls back to your bed?” she asked, teasing.

“Only the ones who mouth off and make me laugh,” Vallia replied.

Iriali chuckled, then stilled. “I think I needed this more than I realized.”

Vallia traced lazy circles on her bare hip. “Touch, or being seen?”

Iriali turned her face into the pillow. “Both.”

Neither of them needed to say more.

Sleep came slowly — not from exhaustion, but from peace. The kind of rest that only arrived when your body had been loved thoroughly, and your mind was too tired to doubt it.

They drifted in and out of it together, waking to soft kisses and wandering hands, sharing quiet stories, stealing warmth. No one came looking for them. No bells rang that either of them heeded. For once, the world outside could wait.

When the sun finally touched the tall arched window, painting golden lines across the wooden floor, Iriali stirred and rolled toward Vallia.

“What now?” she asked.

Vallia opened one eye. “Now?”

Iriali propped herself on one elbow, blanket falling to reveal a shoulder marked by faint bruises and bites. “I mean... after this.”

Vallia considered it. “We could pretend it didn’t happen.”

Iriali frowned.

“Or,” Vallia continued, lips quirking, “you could let me court you properly. Though I suspect you’re not one for flowers and formal dances.”

“Correct.”

“What, then?”

Iriali thought. “Take me to the sparring yard. Let me win once.”

Vallia laughed — loud, unguarded. “You’ll regret asking.”

Iriali smiled back, eyes shining. “I already do.”

They kissed again — slow, familiar now. A kiss not of hunger, but of possibility.

Whatever else happened, whatever stories would be told of the quiet girl who visited the abbey and the warrior nun who bent the rules for her — this was the start of something neither of them expected.

And neither of them wanted to miss.


The hours drifted by without urgency. Outside, the abbey bell tolled softly at the quarter hours, unnoticed by either woman. Vallia’s chambers remained still, cloaked in the drowsy warmth of shared silence and bare skin.

Iriali shifted slightly beneath the blankets, her limbs sore in the best way. She glanced at Vallia beside her, studying the way the warrior’s lashes brushed her cheeks in sleep, the faint furrow between her brows, the way her chest rose and fell in even rhythm. Strength at rest. Fierce beauty uncloaked.

She wondered how many people had ever seen this side of her.

Gently, she reached out and brushed her fingers along Vallia’s collarbone, tracing the dip of muscle, the heat of skin. She didn’t mean to wake her — but the touch was enough.

Vallia’s eyes fluttered open, and she blinked sleepily before offering a small, lopsided smile.

“Couldn’t sleep?”

Iriali shook her head. “Didn’t want to.”

Vallia rolled onto her side and propped herself up with an elbow. “Thinking?”

Iriali hesitated, then nodded. “Wondering if this is just… a moment.”

“A mistake?”

“No.” Iriali looked her in the eye. “A beginning.”

Vallia went still. “You want that?”

Iriali drew in a slow breath, then reached out and cupped Vallia’s cheek. “I want to find out what we are when we’re not knotted together in a corridor.”

Vallia chuckled, her voice rough with affection. “Fair.”

They lay back again, bodies touching in quiet places — calves brushing, fingers entwined. It wasn’t urgent, but it was deliberate. Chosen.

Iriali turned her gaze toward the ceiling. “Do you think the abbess heard us?”

Vallia grinned. “If she didn’t, the entire garden cloister did.”

“Good,” Iriali said, eyes glinting.

There was a lightness between them now, like the heavy fog had lifted. The rawness of need had given way to something easier — teasing, warmth, understanding. Not everything needed to be said to be felt.

After a while, Iriali sat up, dragging the blanket around her shoulders. She stretched, wincing slightly, then stood on shaky legs.

Vallia watched her with undisguised hunger, but didn’t move to stop her.

“I should probably bathe,” Iriali said. “You made a mess of me.”

“You’re welcome.”

Iriali rolled her eyes, smiling, and padded across the room. At the doorway, she paused, looking back.

“When I return, I’d like to spar.”

“You just got your legs under you,” Vallia teased.

“I didn’t say I wanted to win.”

Vallia sat up, sheets pooling around her waist. “Then I’ll be gentle.”

Iriali arched an eyebrow. “Don’t you dare.”

And with that, she disappeared down the hall, hips swaying, leaving Vallia to watch the door long after she’d gone.

This wasn’t over.

It was, in every way that mattered, just the beginning.


The light was softer now.

The abbey’s morning haze had burned away by the time Iriali returned, skin damp from the baths and hair braided loosely down her back. She wore a fresh robe — one borrowed from Vallia, cinched tight at the waist and far too long in the arms. Her bare feet whispered across the stone floor.

Vallia stood at the edge of the sparring circle in the courtyard, a wooden practice sword resting against one shoulder. Her armor was gone, replaced by a simple tunic and tight leather breeches, sleeves rolled to the elbows, her stance already loose and waiting.

Iriali slowed as she approached, her mouth quirking upward.

“I half expected you to vanish.”

“I don’t vanish,” Vallia said. “I wait.”

Iriali stepped into the ring.

The practice was real — and not. They moved, they struck, they blocked and danced and traded smiles between flurries of contact. Vallia held back enough to let Iriali land a few hits, and Iriali gave more than she had, determined to meet her strength for strength, wit for wit.

Eventually, they broke apart, breathless and flushed.

“You’re holding back,” Iriali accused, eyes narrowed.

“You’re adorable when you’re wrong,” Vallia replied, dodging another swing.

Iriali lunged, and Vallia caught her wrist and spun her — gently, deliberately — until Iriali found herself pressed back against the wall, practice sword clattering to the stone.

Their bodies were flush. Again.

Iriali panted, heart hammering. “You’re doing it again.”

“Winning?”

“Distracting me.”

Vallia leaned in. “Is it working?”

Iriali answered with a kiss, swift and full of heat. Vallia’s fingers gripped her waist, grounding them both.

They stayed that way for a long breath — lips brushing, sweat mingling, morning sun turning the stone gold around them.

When they parted, it was not with regret, but understanding.

Later, they sat together beneath the cloister arch, drinking cool water from a shared flask. Iriali’s legs draped over Vallia’s lap, her head tilted against the pillar.

“You’re dangerous,” Iriali said again, voice soft.

“You already said that.”

“I meant it.”

Vallia brushed a strand of hair from her brow. “And you’re still here.”

Iriali nodded.

No vows were spoken. No promises made.

But something had shifted — in the rhythm of the abbey, in the quiet knowing glances they shared, in the way they fit together even when not touching.

It would not be simple.

Iriali was not a nun. Vallia had taken vows — not of chastity, but of discipline, silence, purpose. Still, the abbey had seen stranger things than a girl who wandered in and stayed.

There would be questions.

But for now, there was only this: the warmth of shared breath, the ache of muscles well-used, and the possibility of tomorrow.

Together.

That was enough.


They lingered in the courtyard long after their bodies had cooled and their practice weapons lay forgotten on the stone.

The midday sun dappled through the arches, casting soft golden bars across their legs. A breeze stirred Vallia’s hair, lifting the edges of her tunic, and Iriali reached out without thinking to tuck a stray strand behind her ear.

Vallia caught her hand mid-motion, fingers closing gently around her wrist. She didn’t speak — just looked at her, really looked.

“What?” Iriali asked, suddenly shy beneath the weight of that gaze.

“You touch me like you’ve done it a thousand times.”

Iriali swallowed. “Maybe I have. In dreams.”

Vallia tilted her head. “You dream of me?”

Iriali pulled her hand free and leaned back, lips twitching. “I do now.”

They fell into silence again, but it wasn’t awkward. It was comfortable — the way a pause in music could still feel like part of the melody. Their feet rested near each other, knees occasionally brushing. The warmth between them wasn’t just physical anymore.

“I don’t want this to be a thing that happened once,” Iriali said quietly.

Vallia nodded, her expression unreadable. “Neither do I.”

“But?”

“No ‘but.’ Just…” Vallia looked out at the cloister garden. “I’ve never had a partner. Not here. Not since I joined.”

Iriali studied her. “Because you weren’t allowed?”

“Because I didn’t want to feel like I owed anyone an explanation.”

Iriali nodded. “So don’t explain. Just be.”

Vallia looked back at her, something softening in her face. “You make it sound easy.”

“It’s not. But it’s simple.”

They sat that way until the bell rang again — a long, low tone signaling the turning of the day. The courtyard slowly came alive around them. A few novices passed at a distance, heads bowed, and while one or two glanced their way, none lingered.

“You think they know?” Iriali asked.

Vallia smirked. “Everyone knows.”

Iriali laughed. “Great.”

“They’ll get over it.”

“You sound certain.”

“I am.” Vallia leaned closer. “Because I’m not letting you go.”

The words settled over Iriali like a promise. She didn’t answer right away — just leaned in, resting her forehead against Vallia’s. Their breaths mingled. Their hands twined.

Later that day, Iriali met with the abbess.

The conversation was brief, but not cold. The abbess, sharp-eyed and older than her calm voice suggested, listened without interruption. Iriali spoke plainly — of connection, not scandal; of intention, not apology.

When she finished, the abbess simply nodded. “Then you will stay.”

That night, Iriali returned to Vallia’s room with a small satchel of belongings and a knowing smile. They didn’t talk much. They didn’t need to.

They undressed slowly, not with hunger but with reverence.

They kissed like people who knew what it meant now.

And when Vallia laid Iriali down and pressed herself against her, there was no longer any question of permission, fear, or firsts.

Only trust.

Only love.

Only this — whatever it would become.

Together, they moved as one — again and again — until even the silence between them was sacred.

And when they finally slept, limbs tangled beneath heavy blankets, it was with the peace of those who had chosen one another, not once, but every time after.
