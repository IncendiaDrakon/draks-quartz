# Here We Go Again

Title: Here We Go Again


The abbey bell had long since fallen silent, leaving only the gentle hush of wind through high arches and the low, rhythmic creak of ivy shifting against ancient stone. It was late — not night, but the hour just before it — when shadows seemed deepest and silence most complete. In that hush, Iriali moved alone, her bare feet brushing across cold flagstone, the hem of her robe whispering at her ankles.

She had come to the abbey as a seeker, though what she sought had always been difficult to name. Solace, perhaps. Stillness. Or simply the shape of something that might make her feel less alone. She’d thought the quiet might answer her.

Instead, she found herself haunted by presence — one in particular.

The cloister glowed with scattered candlelight, each alcove casting long fingers of gold across the floor. Iriali stopped beside a column wrapped in flowering vine and closed her eyes. Her breath rose in the chill air, even in midsummer. The stone always kept its cool.

She ran her fingers over the edge of the column, slowly, tracing the worn grooves carved centuries ago. The abbey didn’t speak, not the way people did, but sometimes she felt its breath around her. That’s what she had come for.

And yet...

The air shifted behind her.

It wasn’t sound that made her turn. It was the weight of gaze. Of presence. She opened her eyes and turned slowly.

Vallia stood at the far end of the corridor, half-shadowed where the candlelight didn’t reach. She wasn’t in armor tonight — the hard angles of steel and leather replaced by soft linen that clung gently to the contours of her form. The robe she wore was standard for night devotion, plain and unadorned. But nothing could make Vallia look plain.

She was tall. Powerfully built. Not brutish — far from it — but every step she took seemed to resonate, like the ground acknowledged her. Her black hair was loose, falling in waves past her shoulders. Her skin gleamed pale in the half-light, eyes catching a flicker of violet-blue as she stepped into view.

They had spoken little, in truth.

Not because they didn’t wish to — but because words often felt insufficient.

The first time Iriali had seen her, she had been striking. The second, unsettling. By the third, Iriali had noticed how often her gaze found Vallia in a crowd, how often their paths intersected in places neither of them should have been. Unintentionally — or not.

Tonight, it seemed, neither had anywhere else to be.

They didn’t speak. They didn’t need to.

Vallia approached slowly, her steps unhurried. Her gaze never left Iriali’s. She stopped only when they were a breath apart, the difference in their height throwing Iriali into the curve of Vallia’s chest. Her scent — clean, subtle, edged with something like crushed wildflowers and heat — filled the space between them.

Vallia lifted a hand. Her fingers brushed Iriali’s cheek, slow, reverent.

Iriali closed her eyes and leaned into the touch. Her breath hitched.

There was a question in the air. Unspoken, but not unanswered.

Iriali reached up and took Vallia’s hand in hers. Slender fingers threading with callused ones, small but sure. Her thumb stroked the inside of Vallia’s wrist, where the pulse fluttered.

Neither pulled away.

Not this time.


They moved together without urgency, like two notes drifting into harmony. Vallia’s fingers trailed from Iriali’s cheek down to the hollow of her throat, lingering on the curve there, the rhythm of her pulse. Iriali trembled under her touch, but didn’t step back. If anything, she leaned closer, letting herself be guided by instinct.

Vallia’s hand moved to the tie of Iriali’s robe. She paused, waiting — offering space to withdraw. Iriali met her gaze, her breath steady now despite the heat in her cheeks, and nodded once.

The knot came undone with a whisper. Linen slipped from Iriali’s shoulder, baring one collarbone, then both. Her skin glowed in the soft light — tan-gray, marked with the faintest hint of old freckles and the warmth of sun-kissed travel. She had always been beautiful in movement, but now she was still — and radiant.

Vallia lowered her head. Her lips brushed Iriali’s shoulder, then her neck. Not a kiss — not quite — but the breath of one. Iriali sighed, her hands gripping lightly at Vallia’s waist, feeling the steady rise and fall of her breath.

She pressed her face to Vallia’s shoulder, inhaling the scent of her. The soft threads of linen held the warmth of her body and something beneath it — something uniquely hers. It made Iriali’s knees ache with want.

“You’re not what I expected,” Iriali murmured.

Vallia’s voice was low. “Nor you.”

Iriali laughed softly and let her robe fall completely, pooling at her feet. She stood bare beneath the candles, unflinching. Her body was plush, powerful in its curves. Thighs thick, hips generous, breasts full and soft with the weight of honesty.

Vallia looked at her as if committing her to memory.

Then she stepped forward, letting Iriali undress her in turn. Slowly, reverently, Iriali unwrapped her — pulling the robe from Vallia’s shoulders, baring her inch by inch. Underneath, her body was pale and smooth and strong. Not sculpted like marble, but full of quiet force.

Iriali’s fingers trailed lower, brushing the line of Vallia’s abdomen, past the gentle flare of her hips — and paused.

There, nestled beneath a soft sheath of fur, her anatomy began to respond.

It wasn’t human, not entirely.

What emerged from between her legs was familiar in shape — shafted, rising, thick — but the details marked her as something other. The length tapered at the tip, smooth and glistening, ridged faintly along its underside, already darkening with arousal. At the base, the knot swelled slowly, a heavy orb of engorged flesh still forming. Beneath it, her sex glistened, parted faintly — a mingling of feminine and something far more primal.

Iriali’s eyes widened. Her breath caught.

Vallia stiffened slightly.

“You don’t have to—” she began.

But Iriali knelt.

She looked up at Vallia from beneath her lashes, her hands gently cupping the base of her shaft, lifting it with care. It was already warm in her grip, pulsing faintly, responding to her touch with slow, twitching throb.

“I’ve never seen one quite like this,” she said softly, brushing her cheek to the length. “But I want to.”

Vallia groaned, hips twitching once.

Iriali’s tongue found the tip — a slow, deliberate swipe. She tasted salt, heat, something uniquely Vallia. Her lips parted, and she took her time exploring — licking, stroking, letting her hands caress every new shape and detail. The knot swelled further, heavy and promising at its base, and Vallia trembled above her.

She didn’t try to take her whole. Instead, she mapped her with mouth and hand and patience, drawing out every gasp and tensioned thigh. Vallia’s breathing deepened, and one hand drifted to Iriali’s hair, not guiding, only resting — grounding.

When Iriali rose again, her mouth glistened, and Vallia looked ready to collapse.

She didn’t speak. Neither did Iriali.

They returned to the furs by the hearth — slow, reverent, electric with restraint.

Iriali straddled her slowly, easing her hips down until the wet heat of her sex met the head of Vallia’s shaft. She hovered there, grinding slowly, teasing them both with slick tension.

The pressure mounted with every pass. Vallia’s hands gripped her hips, but didn’t pull.

When Iriali finally pressed downward, it was with a gasp — her body opening around the unfamiliar shape, welcoming it inch by inch. Vallia’s head fell back, and she let out a sound that echoed in the stone chamber — deep, guttural, stunned.

Iriali rode her in slow circles, adjusting to every stretch. The knot nudged her, thick and growing, teasing her entrance with each motion.

And then she sank fully.

The knot slipped in with a wet, aching pop, and Iriali cried out, eyes wide — not in pain, but fullness, overwhelming and absolute. Her body pulsed around it, trying to accommodate the swell. Vallia’s arms wrapped around her tightly.

They stayed like that, knotted, breathing together in open wonder.

Not a word passed between them.

None were needed.


The silence in the aftermath was vast, like the echo of bells that had long since stopped ringing.

Iriali lay draped across Vallia’s chest, her body slick with sweat, thighs trembling from the effort of their joining. Her breath came in shallow pulls, nose pressed against Vallia’s throat where the scent of her was strongest. That knot — still thick and pulsing — kept them locked together, a physical seal of something far deeper than either had expected.

Vallia’s hands moved in slow, soothing circles across Iriali’s back, her fingers tracing paths as if trying to memorize her. One hand stroked through Iriali’s pale hair, the other curved protectively along the swell of her hip.

“I didn’t hurt you?” she murmured, voice husky and quiet.

Iriali stirred slightly, nuzzling into her neck. “No,” she whispered. “You made me feel… full. Held. I don’t want it to end.”

Vallia chuckled softly, though there was a tremor to it. “It will. When it softens.”

“I wasn’t only talking about the knot.”

They lay there a while longer, the fire behind them casting gold against bare skin and stone. Outside, the world remained still — as if the abbey itself respected what had passed between them.

Eventually, the knot softened enough for Iriali to shift. She eased herself off with care, biting her lip as Vallia slipped from her body, leaving her tender and wet and satisfied. A small gasp escaped her, but it was followed by a laugh — breathy, euphoric.

Vallia caught her before she collapsed fully and rolled them both onto their sides, pulling a fur up over Iriali’s back to keep her warm. They settled like that, facing one another, knees tangled, breath mingling between them.

“You don’t speak much,” Iriali said, touching Vallia’s cheek with a fingertip.

“I’m not used to being seen.”

“You’ve been seen now.”

Vallia’s expression softened. She leaned in and kissed Iriali’s forehead. “And you?”

“I wasn’t hiding,” Iriali whispered. “Just waiting.”

A pause.

Then: “Was it what you imagined?”

Iriali smirked. “Better. Wetter.”

Vallia laughed, and the sound was rich and deep. “You’re bolder than I thought.”

“You inspire it.”

They fell quiet again. Not out of awkwardness, but out of peace. Iriali tucked herself against Vallia’s chest, her fingers playing with the soft patch of hair at the base of her belly. She could still feel the echo of fullness between her thighs, the ache of where they’d joined. It made her smile.

Vallia held her like something precious, like something rare.

Outside, the sky began to lighten faintly at the edges. Dawn hadn’t broken yet, but the darkness had softened. A breeze stirred through the high windows, carrying the faint scent of night jasmine and cedar.

Iriali sighed. “We should sleep.”

“Here?”

“I want to wake up beside you.”

Vallia nodded.

They nestled into the furs, the warmth of their bodies more comforting than any blanket. The fire had burned low, but neither noticed. Their hearts were full. Their bodies were spent. Their souls felt… shifted.

It was more than sex. More than pleasure.

It was recognition.

Before sleep claimed her, Iriali murmured, “This isn’t the end.”

“No,” Vallia whispered back. “Just the beginning.”

And in the quiet sanctuary of the abbey, where ancient stone had watched generations come and go, two souls finally touched — not as strangers, not as seekers, but as something far more dangerous and beautiful.

As lovers.

As home.
