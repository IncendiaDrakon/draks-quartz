# Here We Go Again

The abbey bell had long since fallen silent, leaving only the gentle hush of wind in the cloister and the rustling of ivy against ancient stone. Iriali stood barefoot on the cold floor, her robe gathered loosely at her hips, the fabric catching golden candlelight from the sconces. Her hair — a silken pale fall — spilled down her shoulders, framing her thoughtful face.

She had come seeking silence. Instead, she found herself waiting.

The air shifted, and she knew.

Vallia moved with quiet power, each step measured, her long limbs casting elegant shadows down the corridor. She wore no armor now, just the simple linen of the abbey’s evening garb — though even that couldn’t hide the muscular grace of her tall, curving frame. Her long black hair was unbound, falling in waves past her shoulders. Her presence always came before her: heavy, grounded, intense.

Their eyes met.

Iriali didn’t speak. She didn’t need to. The look they shared — one heartbeat, then two — said everything.

They had danced around this moment before. Brushed shoulders, shared glances in the herb garden, fingers meeting at the rim of a shared cup. A growing gravity that bent toward heat.

Tonight, neither turned away.

Vallia’s hand reached out first — a feather-light touch at Iriali’s wrist. Iriali inhaled. Her skin bloomed under that touch like sun-warmed stone. She stepped in close, her smaller frame dwarfed by Vallia’s, yet perfectly cradled within her space.

Fingers slid over cloth. Breath touched neck. The quiet between them deepened, the world outside the abbey walls falling away.

Vallia’s thumb brushed Iriali’s cheek, her expression unreadable — save for the heat in her eyes. She leaned in, close enough that Iriali could taste the slow exhale against her lips.

Then — finally — a kiss.

It wasn’t rushed. It unfolded like a memory they both already knew, lips parting in slow discovery, hands exploring the soft slope of waists and hips. Iriali sighed into her, rising onto her toes, pressing herself against Vallia’s body until warmth passed between them in steady waves.

Vallia’s arms wrapped around her fully, large hands splaying across Iriali’s back. Her kiss deepened, coaxing. The tip of her tongue grazed the edge of Iriali’s lip, a silent request that was granted with a shiver.

The robe slipped from Iriali’s shoulder.

Vallia’s hand followed the curve of her neck downward, over the swell of her breast, her palm cupping with reverence. Iriali gasped, her breath breaking, her hips pressing forward in instinctive yearning. She could feel the heat between them — not just hers.

Between Vallia’s thighs, the linen had grown taut. Iriali shifted, and something thick brushed her belly — warm, firm, growing.

She glanced downward and smiled. “So it’s true.”

Vallia said nothing. She only pressed her forehead to Iriali’s and let out a slow, shaking breath.

Iriali’s hand moved lower, bold now. She reached beneath the fabric and found what she sought — a length hot and smooth, already partway free from its sheath. It pulsed in her grasp. Her fingers explored the shape of it: not human, but not unfamiliar. Tapered. Veined. Broadening toward a knot at the base.

She gave it a playful squeeze.

Vallia groaned low in her throat, her hips twitching once.

They moved together in a hush of fabric and heat, sinking slowly to the thick furs laid before the hearth. The fire crackled softly behind them as robes were discarded entirely, bodies illuminated in flickering light.

Iriali straddled her lover, easing herself downward until the head of Vallia’s length met her slick folds. There was a moment’s tension — and then the first breach, stretching her open inch by inch.

Her head fell back.

“Gods…”

Vallia held her hips with shaking hands, her breath gone. Iriali rolled her hips in small, delicious circles, taking her time — savoring the ache, the fullness, the pressure that built with every inch.

Then, slowly, she sank all the way down.

The knot pressed against her entrance, swollen and insistent but not yet inside.

Iriali met Vallia’s gaze. “Go on,” she whispered. “You won’t break me.”

Vallia bucked once, and the knot pushed in with a pop that made Iriali cry out — pleasure-sharp, overwhelming.

They stilled. Locked together. Completely full.

The world held its breath.

Iriali collapsed forward, her face pressed to Vallia’s throat, heart hammering against her ribs. Their bodies remained joined — knotted — and neither made a move to separate. It was a surrender neither had expected, and neither wanted to undo too quickly.

Vallia’s arms cradled her tightly, one hand stroking the curve of her back, the other threaded into her pale hair. Her breathing was deep and steady, though her cheeks were flushed with the aftermath.

“I didn’t hurt you,” she murmured softly.

Iriali shook her head against her shoulder, voice muffled. “No. Gods, no.”

Minutes passed, their bodies cooling only slightly. The fire crackled on, steady and warm. Outside the abbey walls, wind whispered through cypress and stone — a song older than memory.

Eventually, Iriali stirred. She shifted her hips with a soft grunt, the knot still thick inside her, stretching her with every tiny motion. “Still stuck,” she whispered with a smile.

Vallia chuckled, her voice low and thick. “It’ll soften soon.”

“I’m in no hurry.”

They lay there, speaking little, letting their breaths realign and their bodies settle. Time didn’t seem to move the same way in that quiet, holy space.

When at last Vallia slipped free with a gentle easing of hips, Iriali winced, but the discomfort was brief. She curled closer, letting herself be held, muscles pliant and heart strangely full.

“You could’ve told me,” Iriali murmured, tracing circles over Vallia’s ribs.

“I wanted to. I didn’t know how.”

“You don’t always need words.”

Vallia nodded, pressing a kiss to the top of Iriali’s head.

They stayed like that until the fire burned low and the candles guttered one by one. Outside, morning threatened the edge of sky, but inside the abbey, in the private silence of stone and warmth and skin, the night remained theirs.

And though nothing had been promised aloud, both knew:

This was not the last time.

It was only the beginning.
