# Testy Girl

The air inside the abbey’s side hall was cool, thick with incense and silence. Iriali leaned back against a stone column, arms crossed, chin tilted upward as she watched the tall woman walk past her again. Vallia didn’t speak. She didn’t need to. Her presence filled the space like shadow, graceful and weighty.

Iriali didn’t flinch as Vallia stopped in front of her, towering, motionless, violet-blue eyes fixed on her face.

“You keep walking past like I owe you something,” Iriali said, voice low.

Vallia’s gaze dipped—first to Iriali’s lips, then to her neck, then lower still. Her response wasn’t verbal. She moved closer.

Closer.

Iriali's back hit the column behind her with a soft sound, and then Vallia’s hand was on her hip. Just one. The pressure was maddeningly controlled. She leaned in, not enough to kiss, just enough for Iriali to feel the warmth of her breath. Her other hand skimmed down Iriali’s thigh, teasing the edge of her skirt.

Iriali shivered. “You’re not subtle.”

“I’m not trying to be,” Vallia murmured.

The kiss wasn’t sweet. It was a collision—heat, lips, breath—and Iriali grabbed a fistful of Vallia’s tunic to steady herself. Their bodies fit awkwardly, perfectly. Soft against strong. Short wrapped around tall.

Hands wandered. Hips met. The heat between them pulsed.

Vallia pressed her leg between Iriali’s, lifting her just slightly off the ground, and the smaller woman gasped. She could feel the firm sheath of Vallia’s anatomy press against her through fabric, thick and teasing and so very ready.

“I knew it,” Iriali whispered against her mouth. “You’ve been walking around hard this whole time.”

Vallia didn’t deny it.

Her hand shifted down between them, and Iriali’s breath hitched as she felt the distinctive swell—firm, not human, and already growing.

“Oh,” Iriali exhaled, not quite a laugh, not quite a moan. “Testy girl.”

Vallia’s grin was slow, wicked.

“Do you want to see how testy?”
