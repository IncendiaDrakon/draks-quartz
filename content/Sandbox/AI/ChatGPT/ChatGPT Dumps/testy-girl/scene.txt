The cloister hallway was dark, lit only by the flicker of a votive candle behind stained glass. Iriali’s bare feet made no sound on the stone floor as she crept toward the end of the hall, clutching her robe closed — though she wasn’t sure why.  

She wasn’t cold.  

She had seen Vallia earlier — tall, quiet, watching her. The abbey’s warrior, always composed, always so still. The way her violet-blue eyes lingered just a little too long on Iriali’s hips had lit something hot and strange in her.  

So Iriali had wandered. She'd pretended to be looking for the baths. She had found something else.  

“You’re awake,” came a voice — low, smooth, intimate without trying.  

Vallia stood in the shadows, barely dressed, the candlelight catching on the ink-black waves of her hair. She took a slow step forward, towering and calm.  

Iriali’s breath caught. “Couldn’t sleep,” she offered, heart racing.  

Vallia said nothing. Just stepped closer, and closer still.  

When their bodies brushed, Iriali tilted her head up. Their height difference forced her to tip nearly vertical to meet Vallia’s mouth — and she did. Eagerly.  

The kiss was firm, then deep, then dragging.  

Vallia lifted her — simply, like it was natural — and pressed her back to the cool stone. Iriali gasped as strong thighs slid between hers. Her robe was gone in a blur.  

Fingers traced her slick folds, slow and deliberate. Vallia tested her, learning every quiver, every soft gasp, with silent focus. Then came the pressure of her cock — thick, hot, and shaped with inhuman intent.  

Iriali whimpered as it pushed against her entrance. The head was tapered, but the flare behind it was already stretching her. A long, slow thrust filled her inch by inch, forcing her open with a fullness that made her eyes flutter back.  

Vallia exhaled slowly against her neck, a tremble hidden in the breath.  

Iriali clung tighter, her walls gripping around Vallia’s length as it bottomed out.  

The knot was next — swollen, pulsing at the base, testing her slick rim with every thrust. It teased and pushed and finally breached her in one thick, relentless swell.  

Iriali cried out, her legs wrapping tighter, spine arching in helpless surrender as the knot popped fully inside and locked them together.  

Heat poured into her, wave after wave, filling her beyond anything she had expected.  

Vallia stayed buried, holding her through every twitch and aftershock. Iriali shook, eyes glazed, lips parted around silent moans as the pressure overwhelmed her.  

The knot throbbed inside her. The rest of the world fell away.

Only candlelight, breath, and the slow throb of being completely full remained.
