# ðŸ§¾ Low-Token Export Prompts (ChatGPT + Obsidian)

Use these prompts to save scenes and metadata **efficiently**, without using up your session tokens.

---

## ðŸ§³ Export a Scene or Draft

Say:
- `Zip it quietly`
- `Export without preview`
- `Minimal token export`
- `Just give me the download link`

This will:
- Automatically include: `scene.txt`, `readme.md`, `scene.json`, `tags.json`, and optional metadata
- Skip showing contents in chat
- Give you a `.zip` file immediately

---

## ðŸª„ Output Scene as Copyable Text

Say:
- `Output as .txt block`
- `Give me the plain text`
- `Scene only, no metadata`

Use this when:
- You want to **copy directly into Obsidian**
- You donâ€™t need the zip structure

---

## ðŸ“„ Save Metadata or Notes

Say:
- `Output readme.md only`
- `Give me vault summary`
- `Scene notes only`

This gives:
- A lightweight `.md` file with summary, tags, and draft info

---

## ðŸ§  Token-Conscious Tips

- Ask `token status` any time to check session health
- Avoid exporting scenes longer than ~4,000 words (~3,000 tokens)
- Save often before revision

---

## âœ… Example

```text
Start a new scene. Zip it quietly after. Minimal token usage.
```

This gives you a clean archive without using extra session space.
