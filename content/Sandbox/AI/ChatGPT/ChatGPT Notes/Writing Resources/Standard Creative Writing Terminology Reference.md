- Involves critical evaluation and rewriting to improve clarity, flow, or effect.

### Version
- A parallel or alternate take on the same concept, prompt, or draft.
- May reflect different tones, styles, or directions (e.g., one darker, one romantic).

### Scene
- A discrete narrative unit within a story.
- Focuses on a specific action, moment, or emotional beat.

### Character Sheet
- A reference document detailing a character’s appearance, history, personality, and role in the narrative.
- Used to ensure consistency across drafts and scenes.

### Branch (Contextual Use)
- While not a traditional literary term, "branch" is accepted in game writing, interactive fiction, and speculative drafting.
- Refers to a narrative fork that explores an alternate path or outcome.
- Suitable for creative workflows involving improvisation or story exploration.

## ❌ Avoided or Nonstandard Terms

Keep track of these in your `readme.md` or scene log for clarity and recovery.
