# Emotional Beats

- A moment of eye contact that says everything  
- A whispered “please” / “stay” / “mine”  
- Crying during or after orgasm  
- Laughing in relief or joy  
- Kissing between moans  
- Reaching to cradle face / hair during climax  
- Saying a name like it’s sacred  
- Hesitation melting into surrender  
- Confession murmured into skin  
- Needing to feel connected after it's over
