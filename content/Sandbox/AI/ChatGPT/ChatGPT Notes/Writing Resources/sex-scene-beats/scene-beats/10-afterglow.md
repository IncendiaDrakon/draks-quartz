# Afterglow & Bonding

- Knot still pulsing while bodies stay joined  
- Stroking hair, skin, tails, fur  
- Wrapping arms around each other tightly  
- Breathing in sync, calm returning  
- Whispered words of care or promises  
- Tracing each other’s scars / skin  
- Curling together for warmth  
- Sharing a blanket, cloak, or robe  
- Licking / cleaning each other off  
- One falling asleep in the other’s arms
