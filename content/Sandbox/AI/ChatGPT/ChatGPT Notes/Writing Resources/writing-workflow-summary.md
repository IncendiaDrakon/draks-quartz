# ✍️ Creative Writing Workflow Summary

## 🧭 Core Style
- Genre: Original adult erotic fiction
- Structure: Scene-focused, character-driven
- Generation: Random prompting and branching (e.g., G1 > G1-E > Option 4)
- Creative Process: Improvisational with mental reimagining/revision

## 🧑‍🎤 Character Handling
- Established characters with detailed attributes (e.g., Vallia, Iriali)
- Character sheets in `.json` format
- Long-term tracking via `<name>-evolution.json`

## 🗂️ Scene Management
- Folder per scene: `/scenes/<scene-id>/`
- Each scene folder includes:
  - `scene.txt`: full narrative
  - `readme.md`: scene summary and notes
  - `scene.json`: metadata
  - `tags.json`, `scene-index.json`: optional context
- All `.zip` exports include validated, complete scene content

## 📝 Global Story Tracking
- `scene-notes.md`: master log of all scenes
  - One-liner summaries
  - Status and characters per scene
  - Draft/complete state

## 📄 Preferred File Formats
- Human-readable first:
  - Markdown (`.md`) for scene summaries and notes
  - `.json` for structured metadata and characters
- Avoid `.jsonl` or `.csv` for creative data

## 🧠 Narrative Memory & Preservation
- All metadata captured to support recreation and continuity
- `.zip` exports contain everything needed to restore a full scene

## 🧰 Writing Tools & Environment
- Markdown editors:
  - Obsidian (preferred)
  - Typora, Markor (alternatives)
- Mobile and desktop flexibility
- Readable formatting with minimal overhead

## 📌 Workflow Style: Hybrid (A + C)

### Workflow A: Chat-Driven Drafting
- Prompt GPT with scene/character/premise
- Explore iterations and branches
- Copy/paste selected results to local archive

### Workflow C: World + Story Hub
- Use characters and past scenes as canon
- Reference scene folders and character sheets
- Build storylines over time with linked context
