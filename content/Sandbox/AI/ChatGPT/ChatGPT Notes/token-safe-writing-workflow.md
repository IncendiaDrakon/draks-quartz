# ✅ Token-Safe Creative Writing Workflow
**For: Free ChatGPT Tier · GPT-4o · Android + Obsidian**

---

## 1. 🧠 Session Planning
- Start a **new chat** for each major scene or story idea.
- Limit each chat to **~100 replies** or **under ~10,000 tokens**.
- Use **plain language or markdown** for compatibility.

---

## 2. ✍️ Writing a Scene

### Starting
Prompt clearly:
> “Start a new scene: [Title] — Characters: [Names] — Tone: [Mood] — Tags: [Optional]”

Add constraints:
> “Short scene,” “no dialogue,” “slow build,” etc.

### During Writing
- Ask: “What’s the current token count?” to stay safe.
- If things get long: ask to split or summarize.

## 3. 💾 Saving Your Work

### Quick Export
Say:
> “Output scene as plain .txt block”

### Full Package
Say:
> “Zip this scene”  
(Includes `scene.txt`, `readme.md`, metadata, tags)

---

## 4. 🧷 Metadata (for future use)

Create a `.md` companion file:
```markdown
# Scene: Title
Characters: A, B
Tone: romantic, teasing
Tags: knotting, intersex, etc.
Status: draft/final
```

Ask:
> “Summarize metadata for vault”

---

## 5. 🔁 Revisions & Branches

Use correct writing terms:
- **Draft** = a single full version
- **Revision** = changes to a draft
- **Branch** = alternate direction
- **Final** = locked version

Ask:
> “Revision options for paragraph 3”  
> “Branch with a more dominant tone”

---

## 6. 🧯 Drift Prevention

- Ask “token status” every 20–30 replies
- Avoid exceeding ~12,000 tokens in one chat
- Copy scenes into Obsidian **before** drift risk

---

## 7. 📱 Android & Obsidian Tips

- Use Obsidian mobile app with vault sync (GitHub, Dropbox, etc.)
- Use split screen to copy directly from ChatGPT
- `.md` files preview cleanly in Obsidian mobile

---

## ✅ Summary

> Write clearly. Export often. Save locally.  
> Treat every scene as self-contained.  
> Use metadata to track your stories.
