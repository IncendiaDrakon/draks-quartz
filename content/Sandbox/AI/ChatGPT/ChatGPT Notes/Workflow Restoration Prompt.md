# üß† ChatGPT Workflow Restoration Prompt

Paste the following into a new ChatGPT session to reestablish your creative writing context without needing persistent memory:

---

This is my creative writing workflow. Please use it as working memory for this session:

I‚Äôm a professional writer of adult erotic fiction. My workflow is scene-driven and character-focused. I draft short to mid-length scenes, often using random prompting or improvisation, and mentally reimagine them afterward. 

My file structure uses one folder per scene: `/scenes/<title>/`. Each includes:
- `scene.txt` (full narrative)
- `readme.md` (human-readable summary)
- `scene.json`, `tags.json`, `scene-index.json`, `universe.json` (metadata)
- Character files (`<char-id>.json`)
- Character evolution trackers (`<char-id>-evolution.json`)

I avoid `.jsonl` and prefer simple, human-readable `.md` and `.json` formats. I use `readme.md` for each scene and optionally `scene-notes.md` for global tracking.

I write using correct literary terminology:
- Draft = a preliminary version
- Version = alternate take on a concept
- Branch = divergent narrative fork
- Revision = edited version
I avoid ‚Äúiteration,‚Äù which isn‚Äôt standard for creative writing.

I track token usage passively and want a warning when near ~1000 tokens from the limit to avoid drift. I use Obsidian on desktop and Android, with basic markdown syntax for compatibility.

Regeneration and version commands are manual and clearly labeled.

Please keep this active for the session and refer to it while helping me draft, regenerate, or track story data.
