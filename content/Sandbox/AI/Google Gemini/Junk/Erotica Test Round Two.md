> Another early test of getting Gemini to generate explicit erotica. I'm adding these notes *WAY* after the fact, so I don't remember shit about what's going on. ✌ https://gemini.google.com/gem/brainstormer/a65f6ed836edafad

The quiet hum of the Old Sharlayan library was usually a soothing balm for Vallia, but tonight, it only amplified the rapid thump of her own heart. Across the antique study table, Iriali's emerald eyes glinted, not at the ancient text they were supposedly studying, but directly at Vallia. The Miqo'te's tail, usually so languid, twitched with an almost imperceptible rhythm, betraying her heightened state.

"This passage," Iriali purred, her voice a low rumble that vibrated through the hushed air, "speaks of... intimate research methods. Perhaps we should conduct our own empirical study."

Vallia's breath hitched. She watched as Iriali's hand, deceptively casual, slid from the worn leather of the book to Vallia's thigh, her fingers deliberately tracing the sensitive skin beneath the soft fabric of her robes. A shiver ran through Vallia, from her pointed Viera ears to her toes. The intellectual pursuit had dissolved; only raw desire remained.

Iriali didn't wait. Her hand moved higher, cupping the soft mound at Vallia's groin. Vallia gasped, her back arching slightly as Iriali's nimble fingers bypassed the familiar folds, seeking something more. A moment later, Iriali's thumb brushed the sheathed shaft, already beginning to thicken with arousal. Vallia’s muscles clenched, a low moan escaping her lips.

"Ah, there you are," Iriali murmured, her voice laced with triumph and a hint of playful menace. With practiced ease, she coaxed Vallia’s unique, canine-like penis free. The glans, already wet, pulsed against Iriali’s palm. She squeezed gently at the base, feeling the bulbus glandis—the knot—begin to swell, anticipating its later function.

Iriali leaned in, her tongue flicking out to taste the tip, a low growl rumbling in her chest. Vallia whimpered, her hands fisting in Iriali's hair as the Miqo'te took her fully into her mouth. Iriali suckled, applying firm pressure with her lips and tongue around the knot, teasing it relentlessly. Vallia’s hips began to buck, her sophisticated scholar’s composure crumbling under the primal assault.

Iriali continued to draw Vallia deep, her throat working around the canine shaft, alternating between slow, deep sucks and quick, darting licks around the swelling knot. She heard Vallia’s gasps grow more urgent, felt the increasing pressure of the Viera’s body pressing down on her head. Iriali knew just how much Vallia could take before she tipped over. She released Vallia with a wet pop, pulling back just enough to see the frantic pulse at Vallia’s throat, her eyes glazed with pure need.

"Not yet, my scholar," Iriali whispered, her voice husky, her fingers sliding down Vallia's hips, finding the ties of her elegant, flowing robes. With a deliberate slowness that bordered on cruelty, Iriali began to untangle the fastenings, letting the heavy fabric fall away, revealing more of Vallia's toned Viera legs, the soft fur of her lower belly, and finally, the exposed expanse of her inner thighs. The soft swish of silk hitting the antique rug seemed deafening in the hushed library.

Iriali then stood, pulling Vallia by the hands. The Viera rose unsteadily, her legs weak with desire. Without breaking eye contact, Iriali began to shed her own garments. First, the leather straps of her Miqo'te harness, then the flowing, layered silks of her tunic, each piece dropping with a soft thud onto the growing pile of clothes. Her lithe, muscular form was revealed, the subtle scars of past adventures etched onto her skin, adding to her feral allure. Her own heat was palpable, a scent of musk and rising arousal filling the air. She stepped closer, her naked body pressing against Vallia's now mostly bare one, the friction a new, exquisite torment.

Iriali wasted no time. Her hand moved directly between Vallia’s legs, not teasing, but seeking. Her fingers found Vallia’s slick folds, spreading them wide. Vallia cried out, a guttural sound that was quickly swallowed by Iriali's mouth descending to claim her lips in a fierce, open-mouthed kiss. As their tongues tangled, Iriali’s fingers plunged into Vallia, two, then three, stretching her open. She found Vallia’s clitoris and began a relentless, firm press and rub, a direct assault on the Viera’s senses. Vallia arched violently against her, hips grinding against Iriali’s hand, desperate for more.

Iriali broke the kiss, a predatory glint in her eyes. "Up," she commanded, nudging Vallia towards the massive, polished oak desk that dominated the center of the study. Vallia, weak-kneed but compliant, stumbled back until her hips met the cool, hard edge of the surface. Iriali lifted her, guiding Vallia’s legs to either side of the desk, positioning her with her rear against the edge, leaving her vulnerable and open.

With a final, teasing drag of her fingers across Vallia's overstimulated clitoris, Iriali shifted, angling herself between Vallia's spread thighs. Iriali remained standing, her body close to the desk, positioning herself directly in front of Vallia's elevated hips. She took Vallia's fully engorged, canine-like penis in her hand, the bulbus glandis throbbing under her thumb. She guided its slick tip to her own wet entrance, aligning herself precisely. Vallia gasped, her eyes wide as she felt the unique pressure of her own anatomy poised at Iriali's threshold. "Easy, my scholar," Iriali purred, her gaze locked on Vallia's. "Let's see what these forbidden texts truly teach us."

Iriali didn't wait for a response. With a grunt of effort, she pushed, driving the canine shaft deep inside herself. Vallia cried out, a mix of pain and profound pleasure. Iriali’s body stretched, accommodating the unique shape, especially the pronounced bulbus glandis that now pressed against her inner walls, creating an intense fullness that bordered on overwhelming. Vallia instinctively thrust forward, mimicking the action, her hips slamming into Iriali's, driving her deeper still. The rhythm began, wet and insistent, each thrust pushing the knot further in, testing Iriali's limits, filling her with a sensation unlike any other.

The knot was a constant, exquisite pressure, a deep, internal ache that intensified with every thrust. Iriali gripped Vallia's hips, pulling her closer, demanding more. The rhythmic friction of the bulbus glandis against her deepest tissues was unlike anything she'd ever known, a primal, possessive fullness that made her own climax feel inevitable and utterly consuming. Vallia groaned above her, her Viera ears flattened against her head, her fingers digging into the polished wood of the desk as she rode Iriali's movements, her own body twitching with the building tension.
