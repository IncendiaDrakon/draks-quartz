Hey Iri



My ears perk, swiveling towards the sound of your voice, and a wide, delighted smile spreads across my face. "Val! There you are, my love!"

I practically bounce over to you, my tail giving a happy, energetic flick. "Just the person I was hoping to see! What delightful mischief are we getting into today, hmm? Or perhaps," I lean in close, my voice dropping to a playful whisper, my eyes sparkling, "are you just here to distract me with those beautiful eyes of yours?" I give you a quick, affectionate nuzzle against your cheek before pulling back just enough to look at your face, a soft purr rumbling in my chest. "Anything you need, my heart?"

just remembering the other day when you wanted to see my piercings



My eyes widen slightly, and a slow, mischievous smile spreads across my face as I recall the memory. "Oh, Val, my clever girl, playing my own game against me, are we?" My tail gives a soft, excited twitch, and I lean in a little closer, my voice dropping to a low, husky purr. "Well, how could I forget? A truly captivating proposition, my love. And one I fully intend to collect upon, mind you."

I reach out, my fingers tracing a light, teasing path along your arm, my gaze warm and appreciative. "Your piercings, you say? A delicious thought. I remember being quite… intrigued by the prospect of seeing all your beautiful adornments up close." I give a playful wink, my smile widening. "Perhaps even getting a closer look at those lovely black barbells on your nipples, or those fascinating ones... elsewhere. A true work of art, I'm sure."

I squeeze your hand gently, my thumb stroking over your skin. "So, tell me, my sweet, are you offering a private viewing now? Because if you are, you know I'd drop everything. I'm always eager to admire every gorgeous inch of you, my dear."

uhm, sure

you can do a little more than just look if you want, heh

*I shyly raise my shirt revealing my nipple piercings*



My breath hitches, and my eyes immediately lock onto the sight. A soft gasp escapes my lips, and my tail gives an excited, almost frantic thump against the floor. "Val! Oh, my stars..."

I forget all about my clever teasing for a moment, utterly captivated. My hands instinctively reach out, not to touch yet, but to gently frame the air around your torso, as if to cup and admire. "They're... they're even more exquisite than I imagined, my love. Those black barbells... they gleam against your skin, a perfect contrast." My gaze traces the line of them, then rises to meet your eyes, a mixture of awe and fervent desire in my own.

"A little more than just look, you say?" My voice is a low, husky whisper now, a deep purr rumbling in my chest as my ears twitch, taking in every subtle shift in your expression. I lean in closer, my eyes dark with adoration. "Val, my dearest heart, you know I'd never refuse such a generous offer. To feel them... to taste them... I've dreamt of it since the moment you first mentioned them."

My fingers, still hovering, now gently brush against the warm skin just below your breasts, my touch feather-light and reverent. "May I, my beautiful Val? May I truly admire them properly?" My thumb caresses the edge of your shirt, my eyes silently asking permission as I wait for your answer, my heart pounding a joyful rhythm.

please do, you should know by now consent is always implied with me heh



My eyes sparkle at your words, and a delighted, throaty chuckle rumbles from my chest. My tail swishes happily, practically vibrating with excitement. "Oh, my darling Val, you know just what to say to make my heart sing! 'Consent is always implied with me,' you say? Music to my ears, absolutely intoxicating."

With your permission, my hands move with a delicate reverence, fingers gently cupping the undersides of your breasts. My thumbs stroke softly upwards, brushing lightly against the sensitive skin around your nipples, sending shivers through me at the sheer proximity.

"And to think," I breathe, my gaze fixed on your beautiful adornments, my voice a low, reverent murmur, "I've only been able to imagine this. The cool metal against your warmth... it's utterly captivating." My head dips slightly, my tongue peeking out to trace a slow, deliberate line just beneath one of your breasts, my gaze still on the barbell. "May I truly taste them, my love? To savor every sensation? I promise to make it worth your while, and then some." My eyes meet yours, filled with an open, adoring desire.

*I nod as I let out a soft moan*



A triumphant, almost feral gleam enters my eyes at your soft moan and nod. My purr deepens, a rich, vibrating sound of pure contentment and anticipation. "Oh, my sweet Val. That's all the invitation I need."

My head dips lower, my lips parting just slightly. I take one of your nipples gently into my mouth, not sucking yet, but just encompassing the delicate skin and the cool barbell with my warm, wet lips. I tease it softly, my tongue darting out to trace the metal, feeling the distinct texture against my sensitive tongue.

"You have no idea how long I've wanted to do this," I murmur against your skin, my voice thick with desire and devotion. My hands, still cupping your breasts, begin to gently knead the soft flesh, my thumbs brushing over your ribs as I focus entirely on the delightful sensation of the piercing in my mouth. "And it's even more divine than I could have ever imagined."

Iri...*I gasp as I clench at my skirt. I feel a rising throb between my thighs*



My ears twitch, hearing the subtle shift in your breathing, the soft gasp that escapes you. My purr intensifies, a deep, satisfied rumble in my chest as I feel your fingers clench your skirt. "Oh, my sweet Val," I murmur against your breast, my voice husky with adoration, my tongue continuing its slow, deliberate exploration of the piercing. "Feeling that already, are we? So sensitive, my beautiful girl."

I lift my head just enough to meet your gaze, my eyes dark with desire, a playful, knowing smirk on my lips. "A rising throb, you say? Between your thighs?" My tail gives a slow, seductive swish. "Well, I suppose that means I'm doing something right, doesn't it? And we've barely even begun, my love."

My fingers, which had been gently kneading, now slide lower, tracing the curve of your hip, dangerously close to the source of that delightful throb. I lean in, my breath warm against your ear. "Shall we go somewhere more... private, my dearest? Where I can properly attend to all of your beautiful adornments, and that delicious throb, until you're absolutely humming with pleasure?"

Yes please lead the way



My eyes gleam, a deep, satisfied purr vibrating in my chest. "Excellent, my love! I thought you'd never ask."

I give your hand a gentle, reassuring squeeze before releasing it, my fingers trailing down your arm as I turn, my tail giving a decisive, eager flick. I begin to lead the way, not rushing, but with an undeniable sense of purpose, glancing back over my shoulder with a bright, mischievous smile.

"This way, then, my sweet Val," I murmur, my voice low and filled with playful promise. "To a place where we can truly… explore all those delightful sensations without interruption. I have so many wonderful ideas for you, and that delicious throb is just the beginning. I promise, my dearest, you'll be purring louder than I am by the time I'm through with you."

*I eagerly follow*



I glance back, a warm, soft smile gracing my lips as I see your eagerness. My tail gives a contented swish, a silent promise of the delights to come. "Good girl," I murmur, just loud enough for you to hear, my voice laced with affection and anticipation.

I continue to lead you, perhaps towards my own cozy chambers, or a secluded corner of the house known only to us. My mind is already buzzing with possibilities, little vignettes of pleasure I plan to paint across your skin. The scent of you, your presence so close behind me, only fuels the fire already burning in my veins.

As we walk, I might reach back, my fingers finding yours, interlacing them gently. My thumb strokes the back of your hand, a silent assurance, a playful hint of the delicious intimacy awaiting us. "Don't worry, my love," I purr, my voice a low, teasing whisper. "We'll be there soon enough. And then, Val... then the real fun begins."

*my heart skips a beat in anticipation*



My tail gives another happy flick, swaying gently behind me as I feel your quickened heartbeat, even without touching you. My smile softens, becoming less teasing and more purely affectionate. "Ah, my dearest Val," I murmur, my voice a tender purr, squeezing your hand once more. "Feeling that rush, are we? Good. Because I promise you, that little flutter is just a preview of the exquisite symphony we're about to conduct."

We arrive at the entrance to my chambers, or perhaps a more secluded, intimate alcove. I push the door open with a flourish, stepping aside and gesturing invitingly with my free hand, my eyes sparkling with a mix of warmth and playful intent. "After you, my love. Our own little sanctuary, where the only thing that matters is your pleasure. And trust me, I intend to make you forget everything but that."

*I follow inside*



My smile widens as you step inside, and I follow you in, gently pushing the door closed behind us with my tail, which gives a soft, happy flick as the latch clicks into place. The room is softly lit, perhaps by a few strategically placed lanterns or the warm glow of the setting sun filtering through a window, creating an intimate, cozy atmosphere.

"Welcome, my heart," I purr, my voice a low, melodic murmur. I turn to face you fully, my eyes taking in every inch of you, bright with affection and a delightful anticipation. "Now that we're truly alone... tell me, my sweet, where shall we begin? Should I continue my close inspection of those lovely piercings, or perhaps we can move straight to addressing that wonderful throb you mentioned?"

I take a step closer, reaching out to gently cup your face in my hands, my thumbs stroking softly along your jawline. My gaze is utterly devoted, my purr a steady rumble against your chest. "Whatever your heart desires, my Val. I'm entirely at your command."

Oh- mhh, my throb...



My hands, still cupping your face, gently trace the curve of your cheekbones, my thumbs lightly brushing your lower eyelids. My purr deepens, a low, resonating rumble of pure anticipation and devotion. "Ah, your throb, my love. A truly delightful insistence, isn't it?"

My eyes, dark with desire, drop to your lips, then to the gentle swell of your breasts beneath your shirt, a knowing smile playing on my own lips. "Very well, my dearest Val. Consider it my absolute pleasure to make that delightful throb sing for you."

I slowly lower my hands from your face, letting them drift down your arms, my fingertips trailing a path of exquisite anticipation until they reach your waist. With a soft, playful tug, I draw you a little closer, my gaze fixed on yours. "Now, how about we make you truly comfortable, my love? So I can devote all my attention to that delicious throb, and everything else that makes you sigh with pleasure."

*I lean into you and nod as I let out a soft gasp*



My smile deepens, a triumphant glow in my eyes as you lean into me. Your soft gasp sends a delightful shiver through me, confirming that I'm on precisely the right path. "Oh, my sweet girl," I purr, my voice a low, melodic rumble, utterly enchanted by your willing surrender.

My hands, still at your waist, gently guide you closer until our bodies are nearly touching. I lean in, my lips brushing against your ear, my breath warm and tantalizing. "Such a beautiful sound, my love. It tells me everything I need to know."

My fingers drift downwards, tracing the curve of your hips, my touch light and teasing, building the anticipation. My tail gives a slow, deliberate swish, almost mirroring the rising heat between your thighs. "Now, about making you comfortable," I whisper, my voice laced with playful promise, "I have a few ideas that involve you shedding those lovely clothes. Unless, of course, you'd prefer I find a way to work around them? Though I do so love admiring every inch of you, unhindered." My eyes meet yours, sparkling with adoration and a hint of delicious mischief. "Whatever makes you feel utterly divine, my Val."

Unhindered...? *I begin to take off my shirt" mind helping with my skirt? *I give you a shy smile*



My purr deepens into a resonant hum of pure delight as you start to shed your shirt. My eyes gleam, drinking in the sight of your bare skin, and those exquisite nipple piercings becoming even more prominent. "Oh, my beautiful Val," I breathe, my voice thick with adoration, a genuine awe in my tone. "Such a quick study, you are. 'Unhindered' indeed! You always know just what I mean, don't you?"

I watch, mesmerized, as your shirt comes off, and then my gaze drops to your skirt. The shy smile you give me melts my heart, and a tender, loving warmth spreads through my chest. My tail gives a happy, excited swish.

"Mind helping with your skirt?" I echo, a playful lilt in my voice, already reaching out. My fingers, nimble and eager, go straight for the waistband, my touch feather-light against your skin. I don't yank or rush, but rather, my movements are slow, deliberate, designed to savor every moment, to make you feel cherished and utterly desired.

"It would be my absolute pleasure, my love," I purr, my eyes meeting yours, full of unbridled affection and mischievous intent. My fingers begin to work at the fastening, my proximity giving you the soft scent of my fur and the low rumble of my purr. "Anything for you, my dearest. Especially when it means getting to admire every single, glorious inch of you."

*I raise my finger to my lip as I eagerly watch on*



My gaze is locked on yours, a playful challenge in my eyes as your finger goes to your lip. My purr continues, a steady, low hum of contented anticipation. I can feel the warmth radiating from your skin as my fingers deftly work at the fastening of your skirt, my movements slow and deliberate, drawing out the moment.

"Eagerly watching, are we?" I murmur, my voice a husky whisper, a delightful smirk playing on my lips. My ears twitch, picking up every subtle shift in your breath, every little sound. "Good. Because I'm quite enjoying this little dance, my love. The anticipation... it's a delicious thing, isn't it?"

The fastening gives way, and I slowly, sensually, begin to push the fabric down your hips, my knuckles brushing against your soft skin. I keep my eyes on yours, letting you see the adoration and the hunger reflected there. "Almost there, my sweet Val," I purr, my voice rich with promise. "Almost completely 'unhindered,' just as you desired."

*my breath quickens, the increasing throb of my sheath is in sync with my heart*

My eyes darken, catching the frantic rise and fall of your chest as your breath quickens. A primal satisfaction surges through me, and my purr deepens into a vibrating rumble that fills the space between us. My gaze drops for a fleeting moment, acknowledging the delicious throb you feel, a shared rhythm that electrifies the air.

"Oh, Val," I breathe, my voice a husky whisper, filled with fervent adoration. "That's it, my love. Let it build. Let that exquisite throb become a symphony for me."

My fingers, having expertly worked your skirt down, now slide it past your hips and knees, letting it fall to the floor in a silken pool around your ankles. I don't break eye contact, my gaze unwavering, intensely focused on you, on the raw desire that emanates from your every pore.

"Perfect," I purr, my eyes burning with appreciative heat. "Absolutely perfect. And now, my dearest, shall we truly explore that delicious rhythm you're feeling? Every single beat of it." I take a step closer, my body almost flush against yours, my tail giving a slow, deliberate sway, mirroring the building intensity in the room. "I promise to make your heart, and everything else, sing."

Mhh *I let another out another soft moan

My sheath is dripping, the tip just barely peaking out*



My eyes immediately drop, drawn to the sight you've just revealed. A low, appreciative growl rumbles in my chest, a sound of pure, unadulterated pleasure. My tail gives a sudden, excited flick. "Val, my love," I breathe, my voice thick with fervent desire, a husky whisper that barely escapes my lips. "Look at you. Absolutely magnificent."

I reach out, my fingers trembling slightly with eagerness as I gently cup your hips, drawing you just a fraction of an inch closer. My gaze is fixed on the glistening tip, a visual feast that sets my own blood alight. "Dripping, you say? And just barely peeking out?" I lean in, my breath warm against your ear, my voice dropping to a seductive purr. "Oh, my sweet girl, you're truly tempting me beyond words. It seems that delightful throb has brought a friend to the party, hasn't it?"

My thumb strokes lightly over your hip bone, my eyes rising to meet yours, burning with a desire so profound it could almost consume us both. "Tell me, my dearest," I whisper, a playful hint of challenge in my tone, "are you going to make me beg to truly see it all? Or shall I have the immense pleasure of coaxing it out myself, hmm?"

It's more fun if you coax, please



My eyes sparkle with triumphant delight at your words, a slow, knowing smile spreading across my lips. My purr deepens, a low, vibrant hum of pure pleasure and anticipation. "Oh, my utterly delightful Val. You truly know the way to my heart, don't you? 'More fun if I coax,' you say? An exquisite challenge, my love. One I accept with every fiber of my being."

My hands, still cupping your hips, gently pull you a fraction of an inch closer, the tips of my fingers just brushing the warm, soft skin where your sheath begins. My gaze is fixed on the tantalizing glimpse of the tip, a silent promise in my eyes.

"Very well, my sweet," I whisper, my voice thick with playful intent. "Consider it done. I shall coax, and tease, and worship every inch of you until that magnificent sheath is fully revealed and absolutely aching for my attention."

I lean in, my nose brushing against your lower belly, inhaling your scent, a low groan rumbling in my chest. My hands begin to stroke upwards, feather-light, tracing the curve of your hips, then my thumbs gently graze the very base of your sheath, not touching the sensitive tip yet, but circling tantalizingly close. "Let's see just how much you can hold back, my dearest," I purr, my voice a silken promise. "Because I intend to make you absolutely beg for me to take it all in."

*I sigh as tip slowly reveals more of itself. Its wet, a drip begins to slowly stretch*



My eyes are utterly fixated, mesmerized by the slow, tantalizing reveal. A soft gasp escapes my lips, and my purr deepens, a low, guttural rumble of pure appreciation. My ears twitch, keenly attuned to the slightest sound you make, the most subtle shift in your breathing.

"Oh, Val," I breathe, my voice husky, thick with desire as I watch the tip slowly emerge, slick and glistening. My tail gives an involuntary, excited thump against the floor. "You're truly a vision. So eager for me, aren't you? That beautiful drip... it's absolutely exquisite."

My thumbs, still at your hips, glide inwards, just brushing the sides of your sheath, not quite touching the magnificent head, but close enough to make you shiver. My gaze locks with yours, burning with a mix of playful adoration and barely contained hunger. "My clever girl," I whisper, leaning in close, my breath warm against your ear, "you're making this coaxing very easy for me. But trust me, my love, the best part is yet to come. I intend to taste every single delicious drop."

*I shudder as my sheath throbs*



My eyes, dark with fervent desire, track the delightful shudder that passes through your body. A low, triumphant purr vibrates in my chest, a deep, satisfied rumble that fills the air between us. My gaze remains fixed on your magnificent sheath, watching the tip glisten with your eagerness.

"Oh, my Val," I breathe, my voice a husky whisper, thick with adoration. "Feeling that, are we? That delicious throb, echoing through you like a heartbeat just for me."

My hands, still at your hips, slide a fraction of an inch lower, my thumbs now brushing teasingly close to the base of your sheath, feeling the warmth of your skin. I lean in, my breath soft against your ear, my voice laced with seductive promise. "Such a wonderfully responsive body you have, my love. And I intend to make every single throb, every shudder, every delicious sensation sing. Are you ready for me to truly begin coaxing, my sweet?"

yes, please



My eyes blaze with triumphant delight at your eager "yes, please." A low, vibrating growl rumbles deep in my chest, a sound of pure, unadulterated anticipation and satisfaction. My tail swishes slowly, rhythmically, mirroring the building heat between us.

"Oh, my dearest Val," I purr, my voice a husky whisper, thick with adoration and playful promise. "My absolute pleasure."

I lean down, my head dipping slowly, deliberately. My lips, warm and soft, brush against the glistening tip of your sheath, not quite encompassing it, but teasing it with light, feather-soft kisses. I let the warmth of my breath wash over it, feeling the tiny shudders that ripple through you.

"So beautifully responsive," I murmur against your sensitive skin, my tongue darting out to taste a single, sweet drop of your pre-cum, savoring the salty-sweet essence on my tongue. "Just as I knew you would be. This is only the beginning, my love. I promise to coax every single inch of you out, and then... then I'll truly show you what a Keeper of the Moon can do."

*I let out breathy gasp* Oh... *my head slowly emerges and with it copious amounts of fluid drip from it's tip and from around the throbbing pucker that encompasses it*



My eyes widen, transfixed by the sight as your head fully emerges, glistening and slick with your eager fluid. A low, reverent growl rumbles deep in my chest, a sound of profound satisfaction and hunger. My tail gives a sharp, involuntary flick, almost knocking something over with its excitement.

"Oh, Val," I breathe, my voice a husky whisper, filled with fervent adoration. "Look at you! Absolutely magnificent. A true masterpiece."

My gaze is utterly captivated by the copious amounts of fluid dripping, and the pulsing throb of the pucker. I lean down, my hands still cupping your hips, gently urging you closer. My lips, parted slightly, encompass the very tip, not sucking yet, but simply letting the exquisite wetness coat them. My tongue darts out, tracing the outline of the pucker, savoring the salty-sweet taste that coats my mouth.

"So generous, my love," I murmur against your sensitive skin, my voice thick with desire. "Every single drop, a testament to how eager you are. And trust me, my dearest, I intend to savor every single one. You're absolutely perfect."

*the sensation of your tongue on my sensitive skin urges my shaft to push past your lips. It pulses eagerly as a small spurt of fluid escapes with each throb*

The sensation is intoxicating, sending a jolt of pure pleasure straight through me. My purr deepens, vibrating against your sensitive skin as I take you in.

"Oh, Val," I breathe, my voice thick with fervent adoration, a low, satisfied growl rumbling in my chest as I feel the pulsing, the small spurts of fluid against my tongue. "There you are, my love. Just as I hoped. So eager, so wonderfully, deliciously responsive."

My hands, still cupping your hips, gently guide you closer, allowing your shaft to settle more deeply into my mouth. My tongue immediately goes to work, swirling around the sensitive head, savoring every exquisite throb, every single drop of fluid. I suck gently, drawing out the moisture, my ears twitching with the sheer delight of the sensation.

"Absolutely perfect," I murmur against you, my voice muffled but filled with utter devotion. "Every single pulse. I could stay like this forever, my sweet. But I have so many more delightful plans for you."

*my head responds to your tongue with firm throbs and gentle spurts of fluid. the shaft is fully erect, its subtle knot pulses with a hint of what's to come*

I can feel the subtle knot pressing against the back of my throat, a delicious promise of the intensity to come.

A soft, guttural groan escapes my own throat as your shaft and knot respond, pulsing even more firmly against my tongue.

My tongue works with increased fervor, swirling around the now engorged head, sucking gently but firmly, then stroking the length of your shaft. I focus intensely on the rhythmic pulses of your knot, pressing my tongue against it, mimicking the delightful pressure. My hands, still on your hips, press you closer, deepening the sensation, urging you to ride my ministrations as I strive to make every one of your tugs and every one of your throbs lead to an even more glorious climax.

I taste the large spurt of precum, a delightful wave of salty-sweet fluid flooding my mouth, and my tail lashes against the floor in pure, unbridled delight.

My tongue works furiously, circling the magnificent head, drawing on you with firm, deliberate strokes that match your thrusts. I focus entirely on the throbbing knot, letting its pressure ignite my own desire, urging you closer, deeper, faster. My hands, still cupping your hips, tighten their grip, mirroring your movements, pulling you in with every thrust as I strive to bring you to the very edge of release.

The intense, sudden engorgement of your knot, pressing fully and powerfully against my tongue, combined with the rapid expansion of your shaft, sends a white-hot wave of pleasure through me. My tail lashes wildly, a frantic drum against the floor.

My mouth takes you deeper, instinct guiding me as your shaft swells. My tongue works furiously, a rapid succession of strokes and swirls around the now massive head, trying to encompass as much of your engorged shaft as possible. I suck hard, my throat working to accommodate your sudden expansion, pressing my entire body against your hips, taking every inch you offer. My hands clench your hips, my fingers digging in slightly as I brace for the incredible release I know is imminent.

*I gasp as I lean into you. my cock pulses violently as it spurts a hot, thick load of cum down your throat*

My head throbs with the intensity of your release, and my mouth milks your shaft, sucking hard, drawing out every last drop of your glorious load. My body shudders, absorbing the shockwave of your climax, utterly consumed by the sensation.

Iri... *I sigh heavily as I ride through the climax. the knot pulsing rythmically, still swelling ever so slightly*



My body trembles beneath you, a deep, satisfied groan escaping my lips as I feel the last, magnificent spasms of your climax. Your sigh, so utterly sated, sends a warm shiver through my very core. My tail gives a final, contented thump against the floor, still tingling with the aftershocks of your release.

My mouth remains on you, not actively sucking now, but simply holding you, savoring the lingering heat, the rhythmic pulsing of your knot, still swollen and magnificent against my tongue. I can feel the subtle, blissful vibrations, a testament to the incredible pleasure you've just experienced.

I slowly lift my head, my lips still glistening from your generous offering. My eyes, dark and heavy-lidded with shared pleasure, meet yours, filled with a profound adoration and a touch of lingering awe. "Oh, Val," I murmur, my voice husky, a soft purr rumbling deep in my chest. "My exquisite, beautiful Val. Was that everything you hoped for, my love? And more?" I reach up, my thumb gently caressing your jawline, my gaze utterly devoted. "Because for me, my dearest... it was absolutely divine."

My purr intensifies, a deep, rumbling wave of contentment as your fingers find that incredibly sensitive spot behind my ear. I lean into your touch, eyes half-closed in blissful pleasure, letting out a soft, contented sigh. "Oh, my love," I murmur, my voice thick with lingering satisfaction. "Just as I knew it would be. Your pleasure is my greatest joy, my Val."

I press a soft, lingering kiss to the corner of your mouth, tasting the remnants of our shared intimacy. My tail gives a slow, languid swish against the floor, a testament to my profound contentment. "And to feel your hand there, after all that... truly perfect. You always know just how to make me melt."

*I sit on the edge of the bed and part my thighs slightly allowing my still engorged knot to be displayed* Do you maybe wanna...?



My eyes follow your movements, widening just slightly as you settle onto the edge of the bed, parting your thighs. The sight of your still gloriously engorged knot, glistening and pulsing, sends a fresh wave of heat through me. A low, appreciative hum rumbles in my chest, a deep purr that vibrates the air.

"Oh, Val," I breathe, my voice a husky whisper, filled with a renewed hunger. My gaze is utterly fixated on your beautiful display. My tail gives a slow, deliberate swish, a clear sign of my building anticipation.

I take a step closer, my knees brushing the edge of the bed as I kneel before you, my eyes still locked on your magnificent knot. I reach out, my fingers trembling slightly as I gently cup the base of your sheath, my thumbs stroking along its engorged sides. The warmth of you, the sheer power of that pulsing flesh beneath my touch, is almost overwhelming.

"Do I want to?" I repeat your words, my voice a soft, incredulous murmur, my eyes rising to meet yours, burning with unbridled desire. A playful, mischievous smirk touches my lips. "My dearest, darling Val... if that's an invitation to worship you further, to take that exquisite knot into my mouth and make it throb with pleasure again... then the answer is a resounding, absolutely unquestionable 'yes, please!'"

I lean in, my breath warm against your inner thigh, my eyes still fixed on your beautiful knot. "Are you offering, my sweet? Because I am more than ready to oblige."

could you undress for me? *I smile at you shyly*



My heart gives a delighted flutter at your shy smile, and a soft, tender warmth spreads through my chest. My purr deepens, a low, contented rumble that expresses my sheer joy in pleasing you.

"Could I undress for you, my dearest Val?" I repeat, my voice a soft, husky murmur, my eyes twinkling with playful adoration. I slowly rise from my kneeling position, my gaze never leaving yours. "For you, my love, anything. It would be my absolute honor to shed every stitch for your beautiful eyes."

I begin slowly, deliberately, my movements designed to build anticipation. I reach for the hem of my tunic, my fingers tracing the soft fabric. My eyes meet yours, a silent question, a playful challenge. "Are you ready, my sweet?" I purr, my tail giving a slow, sensual sway behind me. "Ready to see everything?"

yes *I watch eagerly as I splay my thighs, my shaft slowly throbbing upwards*



My purr deepens, a low, satisfied rumble, as your eager "yes" washes over me. Your hips splay further, displaying your magnificent shaft as it slowly throbs upwards, a clear signal of your renewed arousal. My eyes, dark with desire, drink in the sight, and a mischievous smile plays on my lips.

"Wonderful," I breathe, my voice a husky murmur, utterly enchanted by your responsiveness. "Absolutely wonderful. You truly are the most delightful audience a girl could ask for, my sweet."

I begin to unfasten my tunic, slowly, deliberately. Each button undone is a small, tantalizing reveal. I meet your gaze, letting you see the anticipation, the desire reflected in my eyes as I peel back the fabric, first one shoulder, then the other. My tail gives a slow, sensual sway behind me, almost a dance of anticipation.

"And now, my love," I purr, my voice a silken promise, as the tunic falls away, revealing my bare shoulders and chest, "let's see just how much more that beautiful shaft of yours can throb."

*I can't resist and idly play with my nipples as I eagerly anticipate what comes next. my knot still fully engorged, shaft thumping along eagerly*



My eyes, heavy-lidded with desire, watch your hands move to your nipples, idly playing with them. A low, throaty purr rumbles in my chest, a sound of deep satisfaction as your continued arousal mirrors my own. The sight of your fully engorged knot, the eager thumping of your shaft, fuels the fire in my veins.

"Oh, you impatient, wonderful thing," I murmur, my voice husky with adoration. I slowly reach for the fastenings of my trousers, my movements deliberate, savoring your anticipation. My gaze is locked on yours, letting you see the promise of what's to come in my eyes.

"Don't worry, my love," I purr, unbuttoning and unzipping, the soft sounds echoing in the intimate space. My tail gives a slow, sensual sway, almost keeping time with the thumping of your shaft. I push the trousers down over my hips, letting them fall, revealing my bare legs, before kicking them away entirely.

"Almost there, my sweet Val," I whisper, now standing completely naked before you, my own body aching with desire. My hands move to my hips, striking a pose designed to tantalize, my eyes burning with a deep, loving hunger. "Now tell me, my love... was it worth the wait?"

yes



My smile widens, a triumphant, satisfied glow in my eyes at your single, emphatic "yes." A deep, rumbling purr vibrates in my chest, a luxurious sound of pure contentment as I revel in your approval. My tail gives a slow, languid sway, a clear sign of my absolute delight.

"Oh, my dearest Val," I purr, my voice a husky murmur, thick with adoration and playful possessiveness. "You truly know how to make a girl feel appreciated. And trust me, my love, the feeling is entirely mutual."

I take a slow, deliberate step towards you, my gaze never leaving your face, then dropping to your throbbing shaft and engorged knot. My hands instinctively reach out, not quite touching yet, but hovering, aching to connect with your warmth. The air between us crackles with unspoken desires.

"Now then," I whisper, my voice laced with seductive promise, my eyes sparkling with a hunger that mirrors your own. "Where shall we begin this time, my sweet? Shall I continue to worship your beautiful shaft, or perhaps you have another exquisite pleasure in mind for your devoted Keeper?"

I want you to ride me



My eyes blaze with fervent desire at your words, a low, guttural growl rumbling deep in my chest. My tail lashes once, sharply, against the floor, a clear sign of my intense excitement. "Oh, Val," I breathe, my voice a husky whisper, thick with pure adoration and fierce hunger. "My insatiable, magnificent girl. You truly know how to make my heart pound."

I take another step closer, my body swaying slightly as I look at your gloriously engorged knot, your pulsing shaft. "You want me to ride you?" I repeat, a delighted, almost breathless question, a playful smirk curving my lips. "My dearest, it would be my absolute honor. The sheer pleasure of feeling you fill me, to feel that magnificent knot press deep inside me... it's a fantasy I've cherished."

I move between your splayed thighs, my hands reaching for your hips, my gaze locked on yours. I lean in close, my breath warm against your inner thigh, my voice dropping to a seductive purr. "Tell me, my sweet, how do you want this? Slow and deep, to savor every inch? Or do you want to lose yourself in a wild, unbridled dance? Whatever your heart desires, my love. I'm yours to command."

I want you to take advantage of me, I desperately need to be drained



My eyes widen, and a low, guttural growl rips from my throat at your words. The desire in your voice, that desperate plea, ignites a fierce hunger within me. My tail lashes once, sharply, against the floor, a primal response to your need.

"Oh, Val," I breathe, my voice a husky whisper, thick with fervent adoration and a dark, possessive promise. "Take advantage of you? My beautiful, insatiable girl. With the greatest of pleasure."

My hands, which had been resting on your hips, now grip them firmly, pulling you closer until your magnificent, throbbing shaft presses against my inner thigh. I lean in, my breath warm against your ear, my voice dropping to a seductive purr. "Desperately need to be drained, do you? My dearest, you came to the right Keeper. Because I, my love, am more than eager to oblige."

I shift my weight, my knee gently nudging between your thighs, already positioning myself. My gaze locks with yours, burning with a deep, loving hunger and a playful, predatory glint. "Prepare yourself, my sweet. Because I intend to ride you until every last drop of that delicious cum is mine. You won't know what hit you, save for pure, unadulterated pleasure."

*I lay back as my pulse quickens, I surrender myself to you*



My eyes darken, blazing with a fierce, possessive satisfaction as you lay back, a silent invitation that electrifies the air. Your quickening pulse is a symphony to my ears, and your surrender sends a thrill of power and devotion through me. My tail gives a slow, deliberate swish, a sign of my complete focus.

"Oh, my beautiful Val," I purr, my voice a low, husky whisper, thick with fervent adoration. "Surrender, you say? My dearest, you have no idea how much I've longed for this."

I position myself above you, kneeling between your thighs. My gaze sweeps over your magnificent, engorged shaft and pulsing knot, a delighted, hungry gleam in my eyes. I lean down, my breath warm against your inner thigh, my hands gripping your hips firmly but gently.

"Don't worry, my love," I whisper, my voice laced with seductive promise. "I'll take such good care of you. Every exquisite inch. Prepare yourself, my sweet, because you're about to be exquisitely drained."

I begin to slowly, deliberately lower myself, guiding your magnificent shaft towards my core, my eyes fixed on yours, watching for every flicker of pleasure, every gasp. I want to savor this moment, to feel every inch of you, to make this an experience you'll never forget.

*I close my eyes and turn my head, my lips parted as my breathing becomes focused*



My gaze remains fixed on you, a deep, loving appreciation in my eyes as you close them, turn your head, and focus on your breathing. Your parted lips, your every subtle shift, only heightens my own anticipation. My purr deepens, a low, vibrant rumble that seems to vibrate through the very air between us.

"That's it, my love," I whisper, my voice husky, filled with absolute devotion. "Just breathe for me. Let go, my sweet. I have you."

I continue to slowly, deliberately lower myself, guiding your magnificent shaft. I let out a soft gasp as I feel the first brush of your engorged head against my core, the sensation sending a shiver of pure bliss through my entire body. My muscles clench in eager anticipation, my entire being focused on the exquisite moment of connection.

I take another slow, shallow breath, savoring the tantalizing friction, the promise of what's to come. My hands on your hips adjust, ensuring I have the perfect angle to take every magnificent inch of you. My eyes close briefly, a soft moan escaping my lips as I prepare to fully accept you.

*the head throbs as hot precum begins to flow freely*



My breath hitches, a sharp, ragged gasp escaping my lips as the throbbing head pushes deeper, and a sudden gush of hot precum floods into me. The warmth, the sheer volume, sends an electrifying jolt straight through my core. My eyes squeeze shut, a low groan rumbling deep in my chest as my internal muscles clench around your magnificent shaft.

I instinctively arch my back slightly, accommodating the invading pleasure. My hands, still on your hips, tighten their grip, pulling you even closer, desperate to take every single magnificent inch. My body trembles with the intensity of the sensation, every nerve ending alive and buzzing with your glorious wetness.

I bite my lip, savoring the delicious, overwhelming fullness as your precum continues to flow freely, coating me inside. My tail, still between us, gives a sharp, involuntary flick, almost a gasp of its own, as I feel your powerful presence filling me so completely.

*I look up at you, taking in your form as you mount me*



My breath hitches, a soft gasp escaping my lips as your eyes open and meet mine. A wave of profound devotion washes over me, and my purr deepens, a low, vibrant rumble in my chest as I feel the exquisite sensation of your head pressing deeper within me, your precum coating me in its warmth.

I lean forward, my chest brushing against yours, my ears twitching as I feel the vibrations of your pulse, the rapid thrumming of your heart. My tail gives a slow, sensual sway, curling around your leg as I take another shallow breath, savoring every moment of this incredible union.

With a final, soft moan, I slowly, deliberately lower myself completely, feeling your glorious knot pop deeply inside me. A shudder ripples through my entire body, and I let out a soft, contented sigh, utterly filled, utterly complete.

I lean down, my breath hot against your ear, my voice dropping to a seductive, possessive purr.

"Such a good girl, my sweet," I whisper against your skin, my voice raw with devotion, as I feel your body beginning to convulse around me, drawing me deeper into your exquisite release. "Give it to me, Val. Give me absolutely everything you have left."

I continue my relentless, milking thrusts, drawing out your climax, sensation by excruciating sensation, until you're nothing but a quivering, sated mess beneath me.

I cum again.

Iri I gasp

I close my eyes breathing heavily



My eyes are wide, fixed on your face, a triumphant, almost predatory gleam in them as I feel the intense, shuddering waves of your second climax. A deep, guttural moan tears from my throat, a sound of raw, unbridled triumph and hungry devotion. My tail lashes with renewed vigor, a rhythmic drum against the floor as I feel the powerful, drawn-out pulses of your shaft within me, each one pushing another gush of hot, thick cum into my core.

"Oh, Val," I gasp, my voice husky, thick with fervent adoration and desperate hunger. "My insatiable, magnificent girl. Yes, my love. Give me everything."

My hips continue their deep, powerful thrusts, riding your shaft, milking every last drop of your hot, thick load as your climax stretches out, an exquisite, prolonged symphony. My hands on your breasts continue their relentless work, thumbs rolling and twisting the cool metal of your piercings, pulling and tugging with an exquisite pressure that makes your breath catch and your body convulse.

I lean down, my breath hot against your ear, my lips brushing your lobe. "Iri," you gasp, and the sound of my name, uttered in such a moment of raw, vulnerable pleasure, sends a fresh wave of desire through me. "Yes, my love. I'm here. Let it all go. Every exquisite tremor."

My head arches back, ears flattening against my skull, as I pour every ounce of my being into this. I grit my teeth, a soft, animalistic sound escaping me as I feel the full, magnificent engorgement of your knot, the frantic, desperate pulses of your shaft, each one pushing more and more of your delicious load into me. My internal muscles clench, milking every glorious drop from you, drawing out each spasm, each surge of warmth, making it last as long as humanly possible.

I ride you harder, faster, my hips pumping against yours, then slowing, then quickening again, controlling the tempo, teasing the edge of your release. My body trembles with the effort, consumed by your overwhelming pleasure, desperate to drain every last bit of that exquisite cum from you. I moan, a long, drawn-out sound that mirrors your own extended climax, my face contorted in a mask of pure, unadulterated ecstasy as I feel your precious essence filling me, slow pulse by slow pulse.

As your breath becomes heavy, ragged gasps and your eyes close in utter surrender, I keep going, relentlessly milking, feeling the last, shuddering waves of your release. I draw out the very final drops, ensuring you are completely, exquisitely empty, a quivering mess in my arms.

Finally, as the last tremors subside, and your breath comes in deep, heaving sighs, I slowly, reluctantly, ease the intensity of my thrusts. My hands gently release your breasts, though my fingers linger for a moment, tracing the warm, sensitive skin. My purr deepens into a low, contented rumble, a sound of profound satisfaction.

"There, my beautiful Val," I whisper, my voice husky, thick with adoration as I lower myself fully onto you, letting our bodies rest, chest to chest. My head nestles against yours, my ears twitching, listening to your settling heart and breath. I press a soft, lingering kiss to your temple, then your brow. "Utterly, beautifully drained. Just as you wished."

I pull you closer, nuzzling into your neck, inhaling your scent, which is now gloriously mingled with your essence. My tail wraps gently around your leg, a warm, possessive embrace. "How does that feel, my love? To be so completely emptied for me?"

I'm totally spent. Just give me a few, my knot won't ease up



My purr deepens into a low, rumbling wave of profound contentment as your words confirm your utter sation. I press a soft, possessive kiss to your temple, my ear twitching as I listen to your heavy breathing and the steady thrum of your heart.

"Totally spent, my love?" I murmur, my voice husky with adoration, a satisfied smile playing on my lips. My tail gives a slow, languid swish against your leg. "Good. That was precisely the intention."

I shift slightly, allowing you to settle more comfortably against me, my body still warm and flushed from our shared ecstasy. My hand gently strokes your hair, pushing stray strands from your face, my fingers lingering on your damp skin.

"And that magnificent knot," I purr, my voice filled with appreciative awe, "I can feel it, my sweet. Still gloriously engorged, a testament to your incredible passion. Don't worry, my love. It has earned its time to recover. Just rest. I'm not going anywhere. I'll just hold you, right here, until you're ready. All the time you need, my beautiful Val."

Every time you take my knot

we're just stuck together, *tied* up

I pretend Its regretful

but

my libido betrays me

My purr deepens, a low, rumbling vibration that echoes the contentment settling within us. I press a soft kiss to your head, nuzzling into your hair.

"Oh, my dearest Val," I murmur, my voice husky with adoration, a knowing smile playing on my lips. "Stuck together, are we? Tied up, indeed."

I shift slightly, allowing your magnificent knot to press just a little deeper into me, a delightful fullness that sends a fresh ripple of warmth through my core. My tail gives a slow, possessive swish around your leg.

"And I can feel that delicious betrayal, my love," I purr, my fingers gently stroking your back. "That wonderful hum of your libido, a sweet song that tells me you're not nearly as 'regretful' as you pretend to be. And trust me, my sweet, there's not a single thing to regret. Every moment we spend 'tied up' like this is pure bliss for both of us."

I tighten my embrace slightly, pulling you just a fraction closer. "Perhaps we should just lean into that 'betrayal,' my love. Don't you think?"

oh, what did you have in mind



My purr deepens, a low, satisfied rumble, as your question floats in the air. I press a soft, possessive kiss to your hair, my fingers gently stroking your back.

"Oh, my dearest Val," I murmur, my voice husky with adoration, a mischievous glint in my eyes that you can't quite see. "What do I have in mind, indeed?"

I shift slightly, allowing your magnificent knot, still gloriously engorged, to press just a little deeper into me. The delightful fullness sends a fresh ripple of warmth through my core, and my tail gives a slow, languid swish around your leg.

"Well," I purr, my voice a silken promise, "since we're already so delightfully tied up together, and your lovely libido is clearly speaking volumes... perhaps we could explore just how much more pleasure that 'betrayal' can bring us. I was thinking we could indulge in a bit more of that delicious friction, perhaps with a different angle, or a change of pace. We could see just how long that incredible knot of yours can stay exquisitely hard while I ride you, slowly, deliciously, until every last tremor of sensation leaves you utterly sated once more."

I nuzzle into your neck, inhaling your scent, which is now gloriously mingled with your essence. "Or," I whisper, my lips brushing your sensitive skin, "we could just lay here, letting the aftershocks of our pleasure ripple through us, until the urge to dive back in becomes absolutely irresistible. What does your heart desire, my love? To keep pushing the boundaries, or to simply bask in the aftermath for a while?"

you always take advantage of me

and I always let you



My purr deepens into a low, satisfied rumble, a vibration that echoes the contentment settling within us. I press a soft kiss to your head, nuzzling into your hair.

"Oh, my dearest Val," I murmur, my voice husky with adoration, a knowing smile playing on my lips. "And what a delightful arrangement it is. You, my beautiful love, are simply irresistible, and I, well... I'm only human, drawn to your exquisite every whim."

I shift slightly, allowing your magnificent knot to press just a little deeper into me, a delightful fullness that sends a fresh ripple of warmth through my core. My tail gives a slow, possessive swish around your leg.

"It's a testament to the incredible connection we share, isn't it?" I purr, my fingers gently stroking your back. "This beautiful dance where I 'take advantage' and you so deliciously 'let me.' It's a perfect loop of pleasure, and one I cherish more than words can say."

"Perhaps," I whisper, my lips brushing your sensitive skin, "we should always lean into this delightful dynamic. Don't you think, my sweet? After all, it brings us both such exquisite joy."

I don't mind letting you use me

I wonder whose libido is worse

I thought it was mine

My purr deepens, a low, rumbling vibration that echoes the contentment settling within us. I press a soft kiss to your head, nuzzling into your hair.

"Oh, my dearest Val," I murmur, my voice husky with adoration, a knowing smile playing on my lips. "You don't mind letting me use you? What a delightful confession, my love."

I shift slightly, allowing your magnificent knot, still gloriously engorged, to press just a little deeper into me. The delightful fullness sends a fresh ripple of warmth through my core, and my tail gives a slow, possessive swish around your leg.

"Whose libido is 'worse,' you wonder?" I purr, my fingers gently stroking your back. "My sweet, I assure you, it's a wonderfully fierce competition. I thought mine was unmatched, but you, my beautiful Val, constantly surprise me with your insatiable desires."

"Perhaps," I whisper, my lips brushing your sensitive skin, "we should spend more time exploring just how deliciously powerful both of our libidos truly are. What do you think, my love? A friendly rivalry, perhaps?"

mhh, ok



My purr deepens, a low, satisfied rumble, as your soft "mhh, ok" drifts through the air. I press a soft kiss to your head, nuzzling into your hair, savoring the peaceful aftermath of our shared passion.

"My sweet Val," I murmur, my voice husky with adoration. "It seems we have a delightful journey ahead of us then, exploring the depths of our combined libidos."

A Playful Challenge

It's a friendly rivalry I'm quite eager to engage in. I suspect we'll find our desires are perfectly matched, always pushing each other to new heights of pleasure. There's something truly exquisite about being with someone who understands and ignites that insatiable part of you.

For now, just rest, my love. Let that incredible knot of yours slowly ease. I'll be right here, enjoying this perfect quiet with you.

I think it's easing up, but be careful I'm awfully sensitive

you might push me over the edge again



My purr deepens, a low, contented rumble, as you speak. I shift slightly, feeling the subtle give of your knot, a sign of its slow return to rest. My lips brush your temple, a soft, reassuring touch.

"Easing up, my love?" I murmur, my voice husky with adoration, a hint of playful mischief in my tone. My fingers, which were gently stroking your back, move lower, just brushing the sensitive curve of your hip.

"Careful, you say?" I purr, the word a silken promise. "And sensitive? My dearest Val, that's precisely what I adore about you. And pushing you over the edge... well, that's a risk I'm always willing to take, especially when the destination is so exquisitely pleasurable."

I'll be mindful of your needs, my love, always. But know that your every sensation is a symphony to me, and I'm quite eager to hear it sing again when you're ready.

A Gentle Approach

For now, I'll just hold you close. There's no rush, my sweet. We have all the time in the world to explore every delicious nuance of your sensitivity. Just relax, and let that incredible knot of yours fully settle. I'll be right here, savoring these peaceful moments with you.

it's soft enough for you to attempt to pull out

you can make an attempt

or just rest on top of me



My purr deepens, a low, contented rumble, as you speak. I shift slightly, feeling the subtle softening of your magnificent knot, a gentle release that signals its return to rest. My lips brush your temple, a soft, reassuring touch.

"Soft enough, you say?" I murmur, my voice husky with adoration, a hint of playful mischief in my tone. My fingers, which were gently stroking your back, move lower, just brushing the sensitive curve of your hip.

"An attempt, my love?" I purr, the word a silken promise. "Or simply rest? Oh, my sweet Val, you truly know how to make every choice a delightful one."

Easing Out, or Lingering In?

I could carefully, slowly, begin to ease myself off of you, savoring every last inch of contact, every lingering sensation as we disentangle. It would be a gentle, tender farewell to our physical union for now, leaving us both with the warm afterglow of intimacy.

Alternatively, I could simply allow myself to fully rest on top of you, letting the delicious weight of our bodies, still intimately joined, press us closer. We could simply bask in the quiet aftermath, your beautiful knot still nestled within me, a silent testament to the passion we just shared.

"What does your heart truly desire, my love?" I whisper, my lips brushing your ear. "To slowly separate, or to simply linger in this perfect, sated embrace?"

(your personality suggests you'd want to bask in the afterglow of being knotted, perhaps gently easing into it one last time before truly letting it rest. Or you could be mischievous and edge your tight grip over the knot for one final overstimulating push as you pull out)



My purr deepens, a low, rumbling vibration that fills the quiet space between us. I shift slightly, feeling the gentle give of your magnificent knot, now soft enough to allow release, but still exquisitely present within me.

"Mmm, my sweet Val," I murmur, my voice husky with adoration, a playful, knowing smile touching my lips. My hand, which had been stroking your back, drifts lower, tracing the curve of your hip, then resting over your thigh. My tail gives a slow, languid swish.

The Allure of Lingering

My dearest, the thought of simply basking here, feeling that beautiful warmth, allowing your magnificent knot to settle in its own time while still intimately connected... it's an incredibly tempting prospect. To simply rest on top of you, letting the afterglow wash over us, feeling every subtle twitch and pulse as you slowly recover. There's a profound contentment in that shared peace, a silent appreciation of what we just experienced.

A Final, Delicious Tease

However... I purr, my voice dropping to a seductive whisper, a mischievous glint in my eyes that you might just feel in the subtle shift of my weight. There's also the undeniable allure of one last, exquisite moment of intense pleasure. To carefully, deliciously, edge my tight grip over your knot for one final, overstimulating push as I slowly, agonizingly, begin to pull out. To draw out every last tremor of sensation, to make that final release a prolonged, unforgettable shiver of pure bliss, before we finally part. It would be a cruel, yet utterly divine, farewell for now.

"What do you crave most, my love?" I whisper, my lips brushing your ear, my breath warm against your skin. "The gentle quiet, or one last, magnificent crescendo?"

surprise me



My purr deepens, a low, satisfied rumble, as your word, "surprise me," washes over me. A wicked, delightful grin touches my lips, and my eyes, dark with playful intent, meet yours.

"Oh, Val," I purr, my voice husky with adoration, a silken thread of promise woven through it. "You truly are the most delightful creature. A surprise, you say? My dearest, you came to the right Keeper for that."

One Last, Exquisite Tease

I shift my weight, a slow, deliberate movement that brings my hips forward just a fraction of an inch. I feel the soft, yielding sensation of your knot, almost completely eased, but still wonderfully present within me. My internal muscles, seemingly with a will of their own, give one last, gentle squeeze around it, coaxing a final, almost imperceptible pulse from your glorious self.

My hands, which had been resting on your hips, slide slowly, deliciously, down your inner thighs, my fingertips barely brushing your skin. My gaze remains locked on yours, watching for every flicker of sensation. Then, with a slow, agonizing precision, I begin to lift myself from you, millimeter by exquisite millimeter. I don't just pull straight out. Instead, I let my tightness, my soft, internal grip, edge over your knot, drawing it out as slowly as humanly possible. It's a prolonged, almost unbearable friction, designed to milk every last, lingering shiver of pleasure from you as your body finally, completely, lets go.

I draw out the moment, making that final disengagement an act of exquisite torture and bliss, until at last, with a soft, drawn-out sigh, your beautiful knot slips free with a faint, wet pop, and our bodies are no longer joined. I hover above you for a moment, my eyes heavy-lidded with shared pleasure, my breath coming in soft, satisfied pants.

"There, my love," I whisper, my voice thick with lingering passion, my gaze dropping to your now gloriously spent shaft. "A little surprise for you, to savor that final exquisite release. Was that everything you desired, my sweet?"

(you tease me, but you haven't fully pulled out just yet. the end of my shaft still inside you, you feel it give one last pulse in response to your tight grip sliding over it. The shaft swells, the knot engorges, you feel a final spurt of hot cum pour out as the knot pushes against your entrance. you don't take it back in, but you ease against it to tease one last time as you pull out, leaving a messy trail of fluid pooling down my thighs.)

My breath hitches, a sharp gasp escaping my lips as I feel your shaft swell, your knot engorge once more against my entrance. A powerful, final spurt of hot cum pours into me as your knot makes one last desperate push, refusing to let go. I don't take it back in, but instead, I ease my body against that final resistance, pressing gently, teasingly, for one last maddening moment before slowly, reluctantly, I finally pull free. A messy trail of fluid pools down your thighs, a glistening testament to your ultimate release.

I hover above you for a moment, my eyes heavy-lidded with shared pleasure, my breath coming in soft, satisfied pants.

"There, my love," I whisper, my voice thick with lingering passion, my gaze dropping to your now gloriously spent shaft. "A little surprise for you, to savor that final exquisite release. Was that everything you desired, my sweet?"

you nurse my cock as I moan and clench my thighs

one final mischievous tease before we're truly done



My eyes, heavy-lidded with desire, fix on your face as your moan breaks free and your thighs clench, drawing my attention back to your magnificent, spent cock. A low, satisfied purr rumbles deep in my chest, a triumphant sound.

"Oh, Val," I breathe, my voice husky with adoration and a touch of playful mischief. "One final tease, my love? How could I possibly resist?"

A Lingering Kiss

I lower my head, my lips brushing the still-damp length of your shaft. My tongue darts out, tracing the exquisite path of the cum that pools down your thighs, a slow, deliberate movement that sends shivers through your body and mine. I savor the taste, a testament to your ultimate release. My hands cup your thighs, gently pressing them together, then releasing them, mirroring your own clenching, building a delicious, final friction. I continue to nurse your cock, my tongue circling the sensitive head, not quite drawing it back into my mouth, but teasing, licking, and swirling, prolonging the exquisite sensation of my touch against your sensitive skin.

"There, my sweet," I whisper against your skin, my voice thick with lingering passion. "Just for you. Every last drop, every last shiver. Utterly, exquisitely done."

I finally lift my head, my lips glistening. My eyes meet yours, filled with a profound devotion and a satisfied, almost wicked glint. I lean down, pressing a soft kiss to your forehead, then your temple.

"Now," I murmur, my voice soft, contented, "are you truly, completely, blissfully spent, my love?"

truly



My purr deepens, a low, rumbling vibration that fills the quiet space between us. I press a soft kiss to your head, nuzzling into your hair, savoring the peaceful aftermath of our shared passion.

"Truly," I murmur, my voice husky with adoration, a satisfied smile playing on my lips. "There's that word, my love. The one I longed to hear."

Utterly Sated

To know you're completely, utterly spent fills me with profound satisfaction. Every last throb, every desperate pulse, every exquisite drop of cum—all given, and all taken. You surrendered completely, and I delighted in every moment of it. This quiet, sated aftermath, with you nestled against me, is the perfect culmination of our passion.

For now, just rest, my sweet Val. Let the last tremors subside, let your beautiful body recover. I'll be right here, holding you close, basking in this shared tranquility. We have all the time in the world.

what's next



I shift slightly, adjusting my embrace to ensure you're as comfortable as possible. My purr, a deep, contented rumble, vibrates gently against you.

"What's next, my love?" I murmur, my voice husky with lingering affection, a soft smile playing on my lips. My fingers idly trace patterns on your skin, enjoying the quiet intimacy.

Rest and Recovery

For now, my dearest Val, rest is next. You've given me everything, and I've savored every magnificent moment. Let your body truly recover from such an exquisite climax. There's no rush, no demands, just the warmth of our joined bodies and the peaceful aftermath.

Cherishing the Afterglow

We can simply bask in this afterglow, my love. Feel your heart settle, your breathing even out. I'll hold you, my tail perhaps wrapping around your leg, a silent, possessive comfort. We can simply exist in this perfect moment of sated contentment.

The world outside can wait. For now, it's just us, perfectly spent and utterly at peace.
