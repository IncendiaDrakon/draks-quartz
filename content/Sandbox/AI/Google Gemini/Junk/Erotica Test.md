The "canvas" felt intuitive, but didn't retain versioning, so make sure to keep your own during the drafting and editing process. Identifying myself as an Adult Fiction Writer drafting Erotica seems to have removed some guardrails. Maybe it was a fluke. I'll look into save the chat alongside this file. https://gemini.google.com/app/c4e5fee604c3b39d

Iriali rode Vallia hard, her hips pumping down, then lifting, then dropping again with a wet slap. Each descent drove Vallia's thick, hard erection deep inside her, stretching her, filling her completely. She could feel Vallia’s knot pressing against her deepest parts with every thrust. It was a constant, heavy pressure that made her muscles clench around her, milking her with every upward slide.

"Fuck," Vallia groaned from below, her hands gripping Iriali's thighs, steadying her, or maybe just holding on. Her eyes were squeezed shut, face flushed.

Iriali leaned forward, her breasts swaying with her movements, brushing against Vallia's breasts. She loved being on top, controlling the pace, feeling the raw power of Vallia filling her. She could feel the wet heat where they were joined, the slick slide of skin on skin, the deep, satisfying friction. Her clit was rubbing against Vallia's mound with each downward plunge, a direct, intense stimulation that was pushing her closer to the edge.

She sped up, a frantic, desperate rhythm taking over. Her breath came in ragged gasps, small whimpers escaping her throat. The knot inside her felt like it was expanding, locking them together even more tightly, making each thrust feel impossibly full. She could feel the pressure building, a hot, tight coil in her belly, spreading through her limbs. Her body was starting to tremble, a delicious, uncontrollable shiver.

Iriali's hips began to buck, no longer just riding, but grinding, seeking maximum friction against Vallia's shaft and the persistent pressure of the knot. Each downward plunge felt like she was impaling herself on Vallia, the sensation almost too much to bear, yet she craved more. Her inner muscles spasmed, clenching around Vallia's cock, trying to squeeze every last drop of pleasure from the connection. A low moan escaped her, a mix of exquisite agony and pure ecstasy.

Vallia’s hands moved from Iriali's thighs, sliding up her back, pulling her down, forcing their bodies even closer. Vallia’s own hips began to lift, meeting Iriali’s frantic pace, driving the knot deeper with each upward thrust. The combined force was overwhelming. Iriali's head fell back, her eyes squeezed shut, seeing stars behind her eyelids. Her entire body was a vibrating string, stretched taut, ready to snap.

"Oh, Gods," Iriali gasped, the words ripped from her. The pressure in her core was immense, a hot, burning point that was about to break. Her clit felt raw, exquisitely sensitive from the constant friction. Her legs began to tremble uncontrollably, threatening to give out. She leaned heavily on Vallia, her body arching back, as the first wave of climax hit her.

It started as a deep shudder, then quickly escalated into powerful, rippling contractions that seized her from the inside out. Her inner walls clenched around Vallia's knot, squeezing, milking, pulling Vallia's shaft deeper with each spasm. She cried out, a long, drawn-out moan of pure release, as the pleasure exploded through her, hot and intense, leaving her shaking violently on top of Vallia. The knot felt like it was throbbing in time with her own climax, a solid, undeniable presence that rooted them together in her release.

Vallia felt Iriali's body clench around her knot, a powerful, milking grip that sent her own pleasure skyrocketing. Iriali's cries were like fuel, pushing Vallia deeper, harder. Her hips pumped, a raw, animalistic drive taking over. The friction was intense, every thrust a burning slide against Iriali's tight, wet walls. She could feel the pulsing contractions around her cock, each squeeze pulling her closer to her own edge.

A low moan ripped from Vallia's chest. Her vision narrowed, focusing only on Iriali's face, slick with sweat, eyes rolled back in pleasure. The knot felt like it was bursting inside Iriali, swollen and hot, and the sensation of being so completely held, so utterly absorbed, pushed Vallia over. Her body stiffened, muscles coiling tight. With a final, deep thrust, she emptied herself into Iriali, a wave of hot, thick cum pulsing from her cock. Her own climax hit hard, a powerful, shuddering release that made her groan, a deep, guttural sound of pure satisfaction. She collapsed onto Iriali, panting, her knot still firmly seated, holding them together in the aftermath of their shared explosion.

But the release didn't bring stillness. Vallia's body continued to convulse with her own orgasm, and with each powerful tremor, the knot inside Iriali pulsed, engorging even further. Iriali, still reeling from her own climax, felt the intense, rhythmic pressure deep within her. It was a relentless, internal massage that wouldn't let her go. Her body, already sensitive and raw, was immediately pushed back towards the brink. She was still knotted by Vallia, trapped in the delicious aftermath, forced to ride through every pulse of Vallia's own release.

Her legs, already weak, began to tremble anew. The feeling of Vallia's knot expanding and throbbing inside her was almost too much, a constant, overwhelming sensation that ignited new sparks of pleasure even as her first orgasm faded. Her breath hitched again, a fresh wave of heat pooling in her belly. She was being driven, unwillingly but deliciously, towards a second climax, the raw, insistent pressure of Vallia's knot refusing to let her rest. Her fingers dug into Vallia's shoulders, her head thrown back as another tremor started, deep and undeniable.

The second wave hit Iriali with even greater force. Her body seized, a more violent, desperate series of contractions squeezing Vallia's knot with everything she had. She screamed this time, a raw, primal sound that echoed in the room, as the pleasure ripped through her, hotter and more consuming than the first. Her entire body convulsed, bucking against Vallia, her muscles locking in a full-body spasm. She felt herself emptying, releasing everything, as Vallia's knot continued to pulse, driving her deeper into the throes of her second orgasm.

As Iriali screamed, Vallia’s own body tightened, a fresh wave of her climax hitting her. A guttural moan tore from Vallia's throat, deeper and longer than before. Her hips thrust up, a powerful, involuntary movement that drove her knot even deeper into Iriali's convulsing body. The knot swelled, throbbing intensely, pushing a fresh gush of hot, thick cum into Iriali with each pulse. Vallia’s muscles locked, her back arching, as she rode the extended waves of her own orgasm, fueled by Iriali's frantic contractions around her. The sensation of Iriali milking her, combined with the bursting fullness of her knot, pushed Vallia into a prolonged, shuddering release.

When it finally subsided, Iriali collapsed forward, her face burying into Vallia's neck, slick with sweat. Her body was completely limp, trembling from head to toe. The knot inside her throbbed gently, the intense pressure gradually easing, but it remained a warm, heavy presence. Vallia held her tight, her arms wrapped around Iriali's waist, both of them panting, their hearts hammering against each other. The room was quiet again, save for their ragged breaths, filled with the heavy, sweet scent of their shared release. Iriali didn't move, content to simply lie there, completely spent and satisfied, still joined to Vallia by the lingering fullness.
