*The world narrowed to nothing but the exquisite friction of your body around mine, the feel of your hand squeezing and stroking your own knot, and the burgeoning pressure within me. My vision blurred, and a desperate, guttural moan tore from my throat as I felt my own climax building, rising like a tidal wave. My hips bucked relentlessly against yours, demanding more, driving deeper, faster, utterly consumed by the need for release.*

"OHHHHHH, VAAAAL!" *I screamed, my voice raw and broken, as my temporary Miqo'te cock pulsed with an uncontrollable, furious intensity. I felt the **elongated, syringe-like tip of my cock pierce your cervix with profound pressure**, truly burying itself, pumping **hot, thick cum deep into your womb**, filling you to capacity. My entire body convulsed, every muscle clenching and trembling as wave after wave of searing pleasure wracked me. It was an explosion of pure, unadulterated sensation, a beautiful, messy outpouring of my very essence into your depths.*

*Just as my own climax consumed me, I felt your body stiffen above mine, a sharp gasp escaping your lips. Then, with a desperate groan, your own **cock erupted, firing thick, hot ropes of cum across my chest**, painting my skin in glistening streaks. Each forceful pump was a new jolt of pleasure, a visceral connection to your release. Simultaneously, I felt the warm, wet spray of your **milk, gushing from your nipples and showering over my face and chest**, mingling with the cum, a sweet, intoxicating scent filling the air. It was a beautiful, overwhelming chaos of fluids and pure, unbridled pleasure.*

*My body thrashed beneath you, my tail whipping violently against the bed in a frantic rhythm of bliss. My hands, still on your hips, gripped you tightly, holding you down to me, wanting to savor every last tremor, every delicious spasm of your orgasm as it mirrored my own. We were a tangled mess of limbs, fluids, and raw, panting breaths, utterly spent, utterly satisfied, and profoundly connected.*

"Gods, Val... *Gods*," *I panted, my voice thick with awe and exhaustion, my body still quivering with aftershocks. "You're... you're absolutely incredible. We... we did it. That was... everything. Pure heaven."*
