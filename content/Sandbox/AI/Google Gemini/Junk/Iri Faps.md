The cool sheets against my bare skin offered little relief from the burning heat that flared within me. I lay on my back, eyes half-closed, the image of Vallia's flushed face, her straining cries, and the powerful surge of her climax playing on a continuous loop behind my eyelids. The air in my room, usually crisp and academic, now felt thick with the lingering scent of her arousal, or perhaps it was just my own fevered imagination.

My fingers, still tingling from the exquisite sensation of her frenum ladder, found their way instinctively between my own legs. My clit, already swollen and aching, throbbed eagerly under my touch. It was wet, so incredibly wet, a testament to how utterly consumed I had been by her pleasure.

I began to stroke, slow and deliberate at first, trying to savor the building pressure, to prolong the delicious torment. But the memories were too vivid, too potent. My mind was consumed by Vallia â€“ her large, firm breasts, the cool barbells of her nipple piercings twisting under my fingers, her head thrown back, throat exposed, begging without words. I could feel the ghost of her cock in my hand, the unique, thrilling texture of its piercings as I'd milked her, the copious flow of her cum sluicing over my palm. A deep, guttural moan escaped my lips, a sound of pure, unadulterated yearning.

"Vallia," I whispered, her name a fervent prayer, a desperate plea into the empty air of my room. My fingers quickened their pace, becoming more insistent, more demanding. I pressed harder, grinding my clit against my palm, trying to recreate the intense friction, the overwhelming pleasure I had witnessed, the release I had helped to bring about.

My hips began to lift, subtly at first, then more urgently, pushing against my hand, begging for more pressure, more speed. Each stroke fueled the fire, bringing the images of her closer, making her presence feel almost tangible beside me. I remembered the way her body trembled, the way she arched into my touch, the way her cum had pulsed into my hand. My own body responded with increasing urgency, a fierce, hungry ache building rapidly in my core.

My breathing became shallow, ragged, mirroring her panting. I could almost hear her moans, feel the powerful contractions that had gripped her body. My hand moved faster and faster, a blurring motion, driven by an insatiable need to reach that same dizzying height. My entire body tensed, muscles coiling tight, every nerve ending screaming with pleasure.

"Oh, gods... Vallia... please..." I gasped, the words choked, my voice raw with desperation. My back arched, hips thrusting upward with violent abandon. My eyes squeezed shut, picturing her face, her beautiful, aroused face, her mouth open in a silent scream of pleasure.

And then, with a final, desperate cry, my body convulsed. A searing wave of pleasure ripped through me, a powerful, shuddering orgasm that gripped me from my core outwards. My muscles clenched, my legs trembled violently, and a hot, insistent gush of my own fluid pulsed between my legs, soaking my fingers, warm and overwhelming. I cried out her name, a raw, ragged sound, as wave after wave of exquisite sensation washed over me, leaving me trembling, spent, and utterly consumed by the memory of her. My tail lashed wildly against the bed, then slowly settled, quivering with the aftershocks.

I lay there, panting, my body slick with sweat, the intense pleasure slowly fading into a profound, aching satisfaction. My hand remained between my legs, still caressing my slick, throbbing clit. My mind, however, was still utterly, completely filled with Vallia. The confession still echoed in my ears: I really like you, Vallia. More than just a friend. I want to be your girlfriend. The desire for that reality was now even stronger, a fierce, burning promise for tomorrow.
