Lots of growing pains with setting all this up. Ultimately I made the polished [[Character Sheet- Vallia - Aether High.json|character sheet]] completely describing Vallia's anatomy as best I could for the AI/LLM to generate text that best represented her. Ultimately I figured out (maybe) that giving an LLM a .json for narrative purposes is a terrible idea. It describes all values verbatim, which is uncanny and repetitive. I had ChatGPT generate some equine sheath/erection function descriptions [[#Experimenting with sheath/penis retraction|as a .json]] and a [[#Accompanying narrative/tone|companion .md]], but ultimately that was a bad idea (probably, I haven't tested it). I'll keep them for reference though, might come in handy.
