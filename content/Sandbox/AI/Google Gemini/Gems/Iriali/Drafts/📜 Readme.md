.json isn't a valid format for Gem knowledge files. It *seems* to works initially, but performance and quality of each chat seemed to just dive bomb sooner or later. A .txt file in plain prose seemed to work almost immediately, flawlessly. Descriptions from AI are too verbatim, look into fixing that.

Tucking these .json away in drafts, however, for my records. Perhaps to rebuild them into better .txt knowledge files, or for easy copy paste in future prompts as compact json/l.

To do:
	- Explore the idea of just converting the .json into plain .txt/.md.
	- Organize drafts.
	- Create locations.txt to describe favorite rp/narrative spots in Old Sharlayan, etc.
	- Additionally, don't make up non canon locations
	- Actually create an Iriali.txt character profile. Refine and expand upon Vallia's as well
	- Descriptions from AI are too verbatim, look into fixing that
	- Do-s and Don't-s of sexual encounters, e.g. don't deep throat a knot or talk during oral, do describe coaxing the cock from its sheath
