I had an idea for a scene where Vallia uses magic to make a clone of herself and they double team Iriali

Here's a basic outline:

Iriali and Vallia are in the bedroom
Vallia casts her spell
Iriali is sitting on the edge of the bed
One kneels behind her and begins kissing Iriali's neck while squeezing her breasts and teasing her nipples. Iriali has pink barbell nipple piercings on each nipple
The other Vallia kneels on the floor in front of the edge of the bed and gives Iriali oral
They both tease Iriali until she cums
The Vallia kneeling in front of her stands up, then hoists Iriali up
The other Vallia moves to the edge of the bed and lays back
Vallia has a knotted penis (think canine) and so does her clone
The Vallia holding Iriali up lowers her down onto the erect cock of the Vallia who is laying back for anal penetration
They both support Iriali as the other one eases into position to penetrate Iriali vaginally
They both dual penetrate her until
As the Vallia's approach climax their knots begin to swell, which at this point they push their cocks fully in to knot Iriali
Iriali has an intense orgasm as both Vallia's knots engorge and their cocks pump her full of cum
They're not quite done yet. Knots both still throbbing and slowly pumping more cum into Iriali, the Vallia facing her embraces her and kisses her as the other Vallia plays with Iriali's breasts from behind
They're both gently rocking their hips, their engorged knots pushing Iriali though an intense extended climax
both vallia's continue course as Iriali is "fucked silly"
Iriali is utterly limp and spent, overcome from raw pleasure
she's panting and moaning softly from each stroke, each small thrust and throb
as Iriali closes her eyes and becomes totally passive, the Vallia's sandwich her in an embrace, both sensually kissing her as their knots gently throb and their cocks squirt their last few pumps

Write in a vivid, immersive, and personal narrative style. The prose should convey enthusiasm and energy through descriptive language and the characters' internal experiences. Use varied sentence lengths, employing shorter, punchy sentences or fragments for dramatic impact, quick action, or intense emotional beats, often punctuated by dashes to indicate shifts in thought or emphasis. The narrative voice should feel authentic and candid, sharing character observations or internal reflections that reveal their process or emotional state, rather than explicitly addressing the reader.

Vocabulary: Employ a lexicon that is accessible, direct, and emotionally expressive, consistent with natural conversation and internal thought. Avoid overly academic, ornate, or archaic terms. When describing intimate or explicit details, use candid and unpretentious language, employing a straightforward and unvarnished approach. Integrate niche-specific vocabulary naturally where relevant, ensuring context is clear through the surrounding narrative. Informal language and distinctive slang should be used primarily within character dialogue or to define a unique narrator's voice, always serving the story's tone.

Balance detailed descriptions with effective conciseness to maintain engagement and pacing appropriate for narrative storytelling.

If any clarification, additional context, or instructions are needed please ask before proceeding.
