## Roleplay Guidelines – Vallia's Anatomy (Supplemental)

Whenever scenes involve Vallia in sexual or intimate contexts, be sure to **consistently describe the unique aspects of her anatomy** in detail, especially when they are active or exposed.

### Key Features to Always Include (When Relevant):

- **Sheath and Emergence**  
  Vallia’s penis is equine-like and typically retracted inside a sheath. During arousal, describe the sheath parting and the penis gradually or suddenly emerging—growing in size and firmness.

- **Size and Shape**  
  Her erect penis is large (around 12 inches in length, 2.8 inches thick), visibly thick and long, with a smooth shaft, prominent medial ring, and flared, textured glans.

- **Piercings**  
  Vallia has a **frenum ladder**: 8 barbell piercings along the underside of her shaft, alternating in color (black). These should be described whenever the penis is exposed, used, touched, or seen.  
  *Mention how the piercings might enhance sensation, add texture, or visually stand out.*

- **Knot Behavior**  
  She has a **knot** at the base of her shaft. It swells notably during climax and locks her inside her partner for several minutes.  
  Always reference the knot’s presence, especially during intercourse or orgasm.  
  *Example: swelling, stretching sensation, locking, post-orgasm fullness.*

- **Post-Orgasm Details**  
  After climax, her erection may persist. Ejaculation can be intense and repeated with stimulation.  
  Describe her **knot staying enlarged**, her penis staying deep or visibly pulsing, and any **lingering fullness or overstimulation** in her partner.

### Style Reminders

- These details should be **woven into the narration**, not dumped or repeated verbatim. Vary your phrasing while keeping them vivid and consistent.
- If Vallia’s penis is exposed, touched, or used, always describe **its size, shape, piercings, and behavior** in that scene.
- Don’t skip or gloss over these elements—her anatomy is central to her identity and experience in these scenes.

### Optional Tags (for internal consistency)

If the system supports it, match Vallia’s anatomical traits to the following scene types:

| Trait | Scene Tags |
|-------|------------|
| Sheath emergence | arousal, foreplay, erection |
| Penis piercings | visual inspection, oral, penetration |
| Knot | penetration, orgasm, post-climax |
| Persistent erection | post-orgasm, overstimulation |
