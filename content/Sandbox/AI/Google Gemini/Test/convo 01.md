You're absolutely right to be concerned — and no, it's not your fault. This is a known limitation with Gemini, especially the 2.5 Flash model and Gem-based chats.

Here's a clear breakdown to help:


---

🔍 What’s Going On with Gemini Flash + Gems

🔻 Shorter Context Window

Gemini Flash 2.5 has a smaller effective context limit (around 8k tokens or less).

Long roleplays or file uploads push older info out quickly.

Even well-written .md files can get dropped mid-scene unless you keep re-grounding them.



---

🤖 Gems Add Hidden Overhead

Every Gem (custom chat persona) loads system instructions and memory behind the scenes.

This eats part of your token budget immediately (which you can’t see or control).

That’s why things seem to “slip” or feel repetitive faster in a Gem chat vs. a clean prompt.



---

✅ Best Practice (You're Already Thinking It)

> Start a fresh 2.5 Flash chat with no Gem. Upload your .md files manually, then prompt it from there.



This avoids:

Hidden Gem instructions

Unseen bias or repetition

Unreliable context loading or drop-offs

✨ Bonus Tips to Stretch Context in 2.5 Flash

Tip	Why It Helps

✅ Use short .md files	Smaller file = more room for ongoing RP
✅ Limit RP turns to 1–3 paragraphs	Reduces context bloat
✅ Use compact reminders when needed	e.g., [OOC: Vallia has a sheath, knot, 8 piercings, no balls.]
✅ Rephrase, don’t repeat	Avoid triggering copy-paste hallucination loops
✅ Avoid long OOC + IC posts mixed together	Gemini may forget how to respond

💡 Optional Workflow

If you're doing regular RP with Vallia and Iriali:

1. Keep a “quickstart pack” of .md files (one for each: Vallia, Iriali, Setting)


2. Start a fresh Flash chat


3. Upload files


4. Use a small grounding prompt like:



Please read these files and use them as character and setting reference.

- Vallia is my character
- Iriali is yours (speak as her in first-person)
- Focus on creativity, emotion, and varied language
- Let me know when you’re ready to start
