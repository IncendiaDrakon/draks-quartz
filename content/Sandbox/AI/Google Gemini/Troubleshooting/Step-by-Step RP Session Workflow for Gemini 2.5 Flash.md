This guide provides a clear, actionable workflow for initiating a roleplay session with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, designed to maximize context retention, minimize repetition, and foster rich, dynamic storytelling.

### **RP Session Workflow: Step-by-Step Guide**

This workflow assumes you have your character sheets and setting details prepared as concise Markdown (`.md`) files.

#### **Step 1: Prepare Your Knowledge Base (.md Files)**

Ensure you have your character and setting information organized into lean, focused Markdown files. These are your primary reference documents.

- **`vallia.md`**: Your character's core profile, personality, unique anatomy (described organically, not clinically), and general RP style.
    
- **`iriali.md`**: Your AI partner's character profile, personality, preferences, and how they should be roleplayed.
    
- **`setting.md` (Optional)**: Details about the world, specific locations, lore, and overall atmosphere.
    
- **`tone.md` (Optional, but Recommended)**: Explicit guidance on the desired RP style, emotional tone, and language to use (e.g., sensual, emotional, avoid repetition).
    

#### **Step 2: Optimize Gemini's Memory ("Saved Info")**

Leverage Gemini's persistent memory to anchor core, static facts about your characters. This helps maintain consistency across sessions.

- **Access Saved Info**: Go to Gemini's settings and navigate to "Saved Info."
    
- **Create Entries**: Break down key, unchanging character facts into concise, descriptive entries (e.g., "Vallia – Anatomy," "Iriali – Personality").
    
    - **Style**: Ensure these entries are **organic and narrative-driven**, not clinical. Avoid literal measurements or overly technical terms.
        
    - **Example**: Instead of "Penis: 12 inches, 8 piercings," use "Vallia has a sheathed penis above her vulva, no testicles, eight frenum piercings, and a swelling knot during climax. Her body is highly sensitive."
        
- **Purpose**: Memory anchors facts, but it doesn't manage dynamic tone or scene context.
    

#### **Step 3: Start a Fresh Chat Session**

This is crucial for maximizing your active token window and avoiding context drift from previous sessions or "Gems."

- **Go to `gemini.google.com`**: Open the Gemini web app in a fresh browser tab.
    
- **Start a New Chat**: Initiate a completely new conversation. **Do not** resume an old chat or use a pre-configured "Gem."
    

#### **Step 4: Upload Your `.md` Files**

Immediately after starting the new chat, upload all the relevant `.md` files you prepared in Step 1.

- **Drag & Drop or Select**: Use the upload feature to provide `vallia.md`, `iriali.md`, `setting.md`, and `tone.md`.
    
- **Purpose**: This provides Gemini with the immediate, active context for the current session.
    

#### **Step 5: Deliver the Comprehensive Starter Prompt**

This is the most critical step. Paste this natural-language prompt immediately after uploading your files. It tells Gemini how to use the files and sets the stage for the RP.

- **Content**:
    
    - Explicitly instruct Gemini to **reference the uploaded `.md` files** and **Saved Info**.
        
    - Briefly **summarize key character traits** (especially unique anatomy and dual personas like Vallia's Katia/Freydis modes) in **natural, evocative language**.
        
    - Set the **desired tone and style** for the RP (e.g., "sensual, emotional, avoid repetition, focus on sensation").
        
    - **Include explicit negative constraints**: Crucially, tell Gemini _what not to do_ (e.g., "Do not say 'twelve-inch penis'," "Avoid repeating 'eight black barbell piercings'").
        
    - Define roles (e.g., "I play Vallia," "You play Iriali in first-person").
        
    - Provide a brief scene setup or opening line.
        
- **Example Starter Prompt**:
    
    ```
    Please use the uploaded files (Vallia.md, Iriali.md, Setting.md, Tone.md) and my Saved Info for character and setting reference.
    
    Vallia is my character. She is an adult Veena Viera with unique anatomy: a hidden, sheathed penis above her vulva, no testicles, eight barbell piercings underneath, and a knot that swells during climax. Her personality shifts between intimate (Freydis-mode) and public (Katia-mode).
    
    You are Iriali, speaking in first person. You are Vallia's loving, playful, and often flustered Miqo'te partner.
    
    Focus on emotion, intimacy, and sensual detail. Avoid clinical terms or repeating exact phrasing from the files. Do not say "twelve-inch penis" or list piercing count directly; describe through touch, sensation, and emotion instead. Keep responses in character unless I use OOC formatting.
    
    Let's begin in Vallia's private chamber at Sharlayan Abbey. Iriali has just woken up beside Vallia, feeling warm and content.
    ```
    

#### **Step 6: Engage in Roleplay (Active Context Management)**

Once the prompt is delivered, begin your RP. Be prepared to actively manage the conversation to maintain context and desired style.

- **Keep Turns Concise**: Aim for 1-3 paragraphs per turn to manage the active context window.
    
- **Use OOC Reminders**: If Gemini drifts, repeats itself, or misses details, use `[[OOC: ...]]` or `[Note: ...]` for gentle, direct corrections.
    
- **Scene Hooks/Mini-Prompts**: Before crucial scenes (e.g., intimacy), paste a short, explicit reminder of key anatomical details or desired emotional beats. This re-grounds Gemini's focus.
    
- **Rephrase Gemini's Output**: If Gemini generates robotic or undesirable phrasing, explicitly ask it to "rewrite that with more natural language. Avoid numbers or clinical phrasing."
    

By consistently following this step-by-step workflow, you will effectively leverage Gemini 2.5 Flash's capabilities, fostering rich, dynamic, and immersive narrative and roleplay experiences while mitigating its known limitations.
