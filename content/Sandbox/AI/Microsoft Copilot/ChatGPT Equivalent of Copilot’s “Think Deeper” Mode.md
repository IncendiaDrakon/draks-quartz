While ChatGPT doesn’t have a literal “Think Deeper” toggle, you can steer it to deliver the same layered, nuanced exploration by combining prompt tactics and settings. Here’s how to get that deep-dive style:

---

## 1. Explicitly Request Depth and Reasoning

- **Prompt framing**: “Please provide a detailed, step-by-step analysis…”
- **Chain-of-thought cue**: “Let’s think through this thoroughly before answering.”
- **Multi-angle ask**: “Explore this topic from historical, technical, and cultural perspectives.”

---

## 2. Use System and Role Instructions

- **System message**:
    
    ```
    You are an expert analyst. Provide a structured, nuanced exploration of the request.
    ```
    
- **Role play**:
    
    ```
    As a senior world-builder, explain the implications of this naming convention on society.
    ```

## 3. Break Your Query Into Sub-Questions

1. “Outline the core concepts.”
2. “Then discuss edge cases or counterexamples.”
3. “Finally, synthesize these into best practices.”

This mirrors Copilot’s gradual deepening.

## 4. Adjust Model Parameters (If Available)

- **Higher max tokens**: Ensures more room for elaboration.
- **Lower temperature**: Keeps reasoning coherent and focused.
- **Top-p sampling**: Around 0.8 for balanced creativity and precision.

---

## 5. Ask for Structure and Summaries

- **Structured output**: “Use headings and bullet lists to organize your deep dive.”
- **Executive summary**: “Start with a 2-sentence overview, then expand.”

---

## 6. Signal When to Stop or Pivot

- “If you hit a speculative area, note assumptions clearly.”
- “End with three follow-up questions or recommendations.”

---

**Usage Example**

```
System: You are a world-building guru.  
User: Please think step by step and give me a Think-Deeper-style breakdown of how to design a multi-tiered magic system, covering mechanics, lore implications, and narrative hooks.
```

By layering these tactics—explicit depth cues, structured prompts, and role framing—you’ll unlock ChatGPT’s equivalent of Copilot’s “Think Deeper” mode every time.
