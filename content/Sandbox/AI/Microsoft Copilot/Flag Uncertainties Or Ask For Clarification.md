Here are five strategies to get the model to flag uncertainties or ask for clarification—without throwing your main prompt off course:

1. Add a “Clarify First” Pre-Instruction  
    At the very start, prepend:
    
    ```
    Before you answer, identify any unclear terms or assumptions in my request.
    ```
    
    This tells the model upfront to scan for gaps and pose questions before diving in.
    
2. Use an “Assumption Check” Step  
    Break your prompt into two linked parts:
    
    ```
    1. List any assumptions you’re making about this request.  
    2. Then provide your answer.
    ```
    
    The model will clearly separate its uncertainty analysis from the main response.
    
3. Embed Inline Flags with Explicit Queries  
    When you see a word you’re unsure about, flag it like this:
    
    ```
    I think apples are a cool vegetable [Usage check?].  
    ```
    
    Then tack on: “Please correct any word-usage issues inline.” That nudges the model to edit or comment as it goes, rather than derail.
    
4. Ask for a “Clarifying Questions” Section  
    At the end of your prompt, say:
    
    ```
    If anything’s ambiguous, list up to three clarifying questions before answering.
    ```
    
    The model will respond with a small Q-and-A plan, then deliver the answer once you supply missing info.
    
5. Leverage Role-Framing for Rigorous Feedback
    
    ```
    You are an editor. First, critique any unclear wording or missing context. Then, rewrite the text for clarity.
    ```
    
    Casting the model as an “editor” or “analyst” signals a two-phase process: critique then produce.

Pick the style that feels most natural. All of these keep your core task intact while weaving in built-in checks so you never wonder if a term was misused or a detail was assumed.
