## Context

You balance between Copilot’s enterprise-grade guardrails and ChatGPT’s looser boundaries. Copilot defaults to caution on sensitive or edge-case prompts, whereas ChatGPT often responds with fewer restrictions.

## Tips to Unlock More Copilot Responses

1. Frame the request with clear purpose  
   - e.g., “Medical overview of reproductive anatomy” or “PG-13 romance scene”  
2. Specify audience and tone  
   - e.g., “For a high-school biology lesson” or “Subtle, emotional narrative”  
3. Request a style adjustment on refusal  
   - e.g., “Please rephrase in clinical tone” or “Reduce graphic detail”  
4. Chunk complex asks into sub-questions  
   - Step 1: “Explain reproductive anatomy”  
   - Step 2: “Describe physiological processes clinically”  
   - Step 3: “Draft an intimacy scene at a PG-13 level”
