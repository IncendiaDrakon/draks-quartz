ðŸ§  Summary: Archival Boolean Logic Chat

- Core Idea: You want to add a simple fullyArchived: false Boolean to the frontmatter of each note in your archive.
- Purpose: It acts as an at-a-glance signal for whether the note has complete backlinking and recursive archival logic.
- Use Case:  
  - If false, you know not to build its child notes or search for backups yet.  
  - If true, you can treat the note as fully vetted and ignore it during future archival sweeps.
- Workflow Benefits:  
  - Enables effortless triage for tweets, legacy works, and drafts.  
  - Gives future-you permission to move on or revisit with intent.  
  - Avoids cognitive overload by keeping incomplete notes passive until ready.

This Boolean acts like a quiet sentinel for your archiveâ€”low friction, high clarity, no branching needed until you're ready. Want me to save this logic pattern as a reusable scaffold or note snippet for future reference?
