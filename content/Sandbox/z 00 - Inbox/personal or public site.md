Currently I'm musing about my options for a personal private site versus a public portfolio or knowledge base 

Personal private site would basically be my obsidian vault hosted online to share with Ana or my friends 

Public site would be aimed at social media followers and would feature art and mods. Less technical more showcase. 

Potential for making an alternate GitHub account just for a public facing portfolio 

I still potentially need a sound option for all my NSFW works
