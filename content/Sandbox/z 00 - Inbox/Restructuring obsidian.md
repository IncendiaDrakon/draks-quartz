I've been talking to co-pilot about how to adopt ZK style note-taking in a literal sense and breaking up each large note with many sections into a parent note with backlinks to it from child notes 

Basically each child note will have all the random things like additional high Fidelity renders telegram archives social media posts and personal notes 

Each of these instead of being sectioned of a larger note will all be smaller self-contained notes that link to the parent note 

And when I view the main note or the parent note it will appear to have many backlinks these backlinks will all be the various broken up parts of my creative process 

Potentially to maintain some kind of cohesion there should be a main note that has the render and its caption which is more oriented towards Twitter or blue sky posting 

Then it'll have a back link to a index note 

The index note will then be back linked to all the other various notes 

So it'll flow something like; parent note. Index note. All other notes

I don't even know how to say this German word and I think it's just called ZK note-taking 

But my weird linux/windows folder architecture logic and OCD tendencies are severely holding me back from just organically making a post that could then Branch off into all related files and processes 

I guess TL DR is make a note based on what I would tweet 

That note is followed by an index note 

That index note is then the central hub for all the backlinks which then can just Branch recursively for however long they need to 

So then with my obsidian involved having all of this in mind I can then easily catalog my renders and all their associated files 

My file system can look however it needs to be whether I keep maintaining the year month folder structure 

Or split it into year month universe genre 

I'll fundamentally have an offline Twitter archive that then branches off into the high Fidelity renders and all the various things I keep so that I can iterate upon my renders and characters
