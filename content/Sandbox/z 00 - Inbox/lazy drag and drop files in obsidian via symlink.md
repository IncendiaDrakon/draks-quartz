## 🛋️ Lazy Drag Protocol — Symlink Edition
**Context:** Working with symlinked folders in Obsidian vault, avoiding clutter from accidental imports.

**Workflow:**  
If you **open the vault folder via the symlinked path in Windows Explorer**, you can safely drag `.png` or other assets directly into Obsidian notes _without creating unwanted duplicates_.  
This method bypasses the root-drop import behavior and leverages the symlink origin as vault-native context.

**Advantages:**  
- No copy created in vault root
- No need to navigate Obsidian’s cramped folder panel
- Seamless integration of external files into note bodies

**Example Use:**  
- Dragging screenshots from symlinked `Canvases` folder into canvas or daily notes
- Embedding image assets with lazy finesse

**Tag:** `#vault-habit` `#ergonomic-imports` `#symlink-nuance`

**Status:** 🟢 Stable pattern. Lightens UI friction, honors asset hygiene.
