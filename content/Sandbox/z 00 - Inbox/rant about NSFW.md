Basically I was venting to copilot about my woes regarding NSFW content creation and social media personas and/or accounts 

Talking to it felt like a bit of an echo chamber but it did, after being prompted to, play devil's advocate with me a bit 

And I should probably continue that conversation in a new chat since it got pretty run on 

I think my idea was going to be discussing strategies for staging reposts alongside creating notes to catalog my works 

And some thoughts I'd hadn't expressed yet were about potential angles to cash out on Vallia or adjacent characters for NSFW clout
