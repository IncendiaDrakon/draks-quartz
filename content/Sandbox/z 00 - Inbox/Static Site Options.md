Options for a static site hosted on GitHub pages or neocities 

Jekyll
Hugo
[[Quartz 4]]

Jekyll is familiar for blogging or a portfolio

however quartz seems like a good option since I use obsidian all the time 

In the case of obsidian I keep notes and catalog indexes on my PC which I could then mirror to a public site 

Potential ideas are for blender renders final Fantasy screenshots baldur's gate content etc 

I could host pages for my final fantasy mods and any related info the same goes for baldur's gate 

Catalog my blender files along with the resulting renders any notes related to them

[[personal or public site]]
