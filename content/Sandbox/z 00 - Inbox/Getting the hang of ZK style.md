I think I started here: [[Restructuring obsidian]]

My main goal, assuming I don't burn out or it actually sticks and is useful is to adopt the Zettelkasten system for Obsidian notes.

I'm really indecisive when it comes to \#tagging so I'm making \[\[anchor pages]] that'll sit in the YAML frontmatter of notes. This way if I decide to change a "tag", it'll be dynamically updated vault wide and I won't have to go hunt down tons of notes and manually edit their frontmatter or contents because I decided to rework my system on a whim.

Additionally, with this system each "tag" note serves as a page where I can write notes to myself or whoever else might be trying to read my notes. (Hello, potential onlooker! ðŸ‘‹)

This only really works internally for Obsidian, so if I publish or copy these contents elsewhere I'll have to change the links to something platform specific.
