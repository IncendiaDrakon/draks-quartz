Basically I was using to co-pilot about how I wear female clothing combined with nail clothing for comfort and function

Ultimately it was a random question about whether I should stay hot to sweat or stay cool when exercising 

And then it sort of just branched off into talking about what I actually wear. In this case it's combination of female and male clothing. I also touched upon how I'll sometimes just wear exclusively female clothes went out for a walk at night. And I vaguely touched upon my reasoning for wearing female jeggings while still trying to be male presenting.
