microsoft copilot came up with the idea of making render.md files in obsidian to catalogue all my 3d renders
their raw output dumps, .blend files, and associated ideas and assets are all stored on Telegram
the general idea is
"render.md" exists locally as a reference file
it contains yaml frontmatter for tagging and sorting
the render/image displayed via hotlink from an online host
some notes about the render
links to telegram showing where to find all the associated files that are backed up/archived on telegram
links to social media/blog posts where the render has been posted
the .md file which is only 3kb displays the render and shows where gigabytes worth of data that's backed up across several different Telegram chats and channels.

That's a smart and elegant system — lightweight, centralized reference files (`render.md`) that link out to heavy assets and contextual info. This lets you keep your working environment (like Obsidian) fast and clean while cataloguing large and distributed creative work.

Here’s how you could structure the `render.md` file as a standard template, balancing clarity, functionality, and long-term maintainability:

## 🧠 Concept & Notes

Refinement of previous Mecha Raven concept. Focus on feather-like mechanical plating and neon-blue underglow. Reworked background to better evoke depth and urban scale.

- Added subtle lens flare for cinematic feel
- Tried new shader layering for feathers
- Need to revisit eyes if version 3 is planned

### ✅ Benefits of this System

- **Scalability**: Each render has its own self-contained `.md` file (just a few KB), but fully maps to gigabytes of assets archived elsewhere.
    
- **Offline Usability**: Still useful even if Telegram or image host is temporarily down.
    
- **Obsidian Integration**: Enables tag-based search, backlinks, graph view, etc.
    
- **Future-proof**: Frontmatter supports easy parsing into gallery systems, static sites (like Hugo), or even automation scripts.

### 🛠 Tips to Level It Up

- **Tag Standardization**: Create a fixed taxonomy for tags like `status`, `theme`, or `render_engine` to keep sorting clean.
    
- **Auto-Sync with Telegram**: Use tools like [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) (Python library) to periodically dump links from specific Telegram chats if you want an auto-updated archive.
    
- **Bulk Viewer**: Use an Obsidian plugin or a script to generate a gallery view across all `render.md` files.
    
- **Backlinking**: Add backlinks in your Telegram chats (via pinned messages or hashtags) so the `.md` and Telegram references stay in sync both ways.
    

Would you like a script or Obsidian plugin suggestion to manage this at scale (e.g. auto-index all `render.md` files into a gallery or dashboard)?
