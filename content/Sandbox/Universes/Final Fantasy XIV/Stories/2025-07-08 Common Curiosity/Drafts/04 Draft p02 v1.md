Got it—here’s a **prose continuation based on 1D: Building Toward Release**, focusing on Iriali’s curious, deliberate exploration and Vallia’s increasing tension.

Iriali wiped the corner of her mouth with the back of her hand, her eyes still fixed on Vallia. The sight of her—cheeks flushed, hands gripping the edge of her skirt, shaft slick and twitching in the open air—was impossible to look away from.

“You’re sensitive,” Iriali said softly, not a question.

Vallia gave the smallest nod, her voice stuck somewhere behind parted lips.

Iriali let her fingertips trail down the underside again, slow and careful, brushing the first of the tiny barbells. Vallia tensed instantly, her breath catching, her hips flinching despite the way she tried to stay still. The metal was warm from her body, slick with the tension that still hadn’t left her.

Iriali adjusted her position, settling on her knees beside Vallia’s chair, leaning in. Her other hand joined the first, thumb gliding along the ridge just above the knot, her fingers curled lightly around the base.

“Tell me if anything’s too much,” she murmured, and then didn’t wait.

She leaned in and flicked her tongue over the first piercing.

Vallia’s reaction was immediate—a sharp breath, a twitch of her hips, the softest gasp barely making it past her lips. Iriali didn’t stop. She traced each barbell with the tip of her tongue, warm and slow, moving steadily down the line. Between strokes, she wrapped her hand around Vallia’s shaft and gave it a slow pump, careful to keep her rhythm unhurried.

Vallia was already trembling.

By the time Iriali reached the fourth piercing, her tongue brushing just beside the swelling knot, Vallia’s breath had turned to soft whimpers. Iriali paused there, letting her lips rest against the warm skin, her breath teasing. She felt the pulse, the thick weight of arousal growing.

“You’re close already,” she whispered, lips brushing against the slick surface.

Vallia tried to speak but only managed a breathy sound, hips straining upward.

Iriali’s hand stroked again, a little firmer now, circling her grip at the base, pressing into the underside where the piercings met. Her tongue flicked back up, slower this time, tracing the same path with more pressure. Every time she passed over a barbell, Vallia twitched, her thighs trembling with the effort to stay still.

And then Iriali moved her hand again—this time curling her fingers just below the knot, squeezing gently while her other hand worked the shaft with slow, tight motions.

Vallia’s breath hitched into something higher. Her legs tensed. She tried to warn her, but the words dissolved into a sharp gasp as Iriali’s tongue pressed just beneath the tip and stayed there, teasing.

That was enough.

With a choked cry, Vallia came—her hips bucking once, helplessly, as thick fluid spilled from the tip in slow, hot pulses. Iriali didn’t flinch. She kept her mouth close, her hand stroking gently through every twitch, her tongue licking slowly, deliberately, collecting every drop.

Vallia sank back into the cushions, eyes unfocused, thighs still shaking.

Iriali licked her lips, finally glancing up. “Still shy?”

Vallia’s breath came in short, quiet bursts. She nodded. But she was smiling.
