Great! Here's a short prose version of the scene—focused, suggestive, and character-driven, following your outline:

The late afternoon sun spilled gently into the abbey’s common room, casting warm light over worn cushions and the two girls sprawled across them. Vallia sat relaxed, one leg draped over the armrest of her chair, her skirt riding high, her top light and loose. Iriali was curled up nearby with a cup of tea in her hands, teal eyes flicking over Vallia’s body with casual interest.

“I like your tattoos,” Iriali said, voice easy, but her gaze lingered a little longer than casual on Vallia’s bare stomach.

Vallia grinned, pleased. “You do?” She straightened up, tugging her loose top higher with one hand to show off the design curling under her ribs. The motion was fast, careless — and as the fabric lifted, so did more than just the ink.

Iriali blinked. One of Vallia’s nipples had slipped into view, the purple barbell glinting in the sunlight.

“Those are cool, too,” Iriali added smoothly, nodding toward it, her tone more amused than flustered.

Vallia hesitated, suddenly self-conscious. “Oh—uh... both are done,” she said, cheeks warming as she raised her shirt further, exposing both piercings now with a kind of sheepish pride.

Iriali’s smile curled. She leaned forward slightly, pretending not to notice how red Vallia’s ears had gone. “Nice symmetry.”

Vallia tried to laugh it off, brushing her hair behind one ear. “That’s not the only place I’ve got them…”

Iriali arched a brow, her tone low and curious. “No?”

Vallia looked away for a second, biting her lip. Then, slowly, she stood and slid her thumbs into the band of her skirt. “Want to see?”

Iriali nodded, her expression unreadable, eyes fixed on Vallia’s hands.

With careful fingers, Vallia eased her skirt down and let her sheath part naturally, baring her length — already starting to swell, already glistening. Along the underside, a line of glinting barbells trailed all the way to the base, alternating purple and black.

Iriali stared. “Those are…”

“Frenum piercings,” Vallia offered, nervous now, shifting her weight. “Eight of them.”

“They’re beautiful,” Iriali said honestly.

Her hand rose without thinking, hovering, then settling lightly along the shaft. Vallia inhaled sharply, hips twitching as her cock pulsed under Iriali’s touch, already beginning to leak.

Iriali’s gaze flicked to the tip. Without speaking, she leaned in, tongue flicking out to taste the first bead that had gathered there.

Vallia let out a shaky breath.

Then Iriali, curious, cupped gently at the base and squeezed the swelling knot.

It pulsed hard — and with a sudden, warm burst, Vallia let out a helpless noise as a thin arc of fluid landed across Iriali’s cheek and lips.

Iriali froze, blinking. Then laughed — quiet, surprised — licking the corner of her mouth as Vallia buried her face in both hands.
