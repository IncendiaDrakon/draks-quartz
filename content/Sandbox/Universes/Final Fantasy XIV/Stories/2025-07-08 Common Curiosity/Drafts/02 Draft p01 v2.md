Absolutely. Here's a revised version with a **shy yet emboldened Vallia**, and a **focus on their interaction**—light on setting, rich in tension and expression:

The common room was quiet, warm with late light, the two of them lounging in soft silence.

“I like your tattoos,” Iriali said, eyes tracing the curve of Vallia’s side where ink peeked from beneath her top.

Vallia looked up quickly, blinking. “Y-you do?”

Iriali smiled, a little amused at how surprised she sounded. “Mm-hmm. They're... graceful.”

Vallia hesitated, then pulled at the hem of her shirt, lifting it just enough to show the line of ink that curved beneath her ribs. “This one wraps all the way under,” she said softly.

Iriali’s gaze followed, and as Vallia adjusted the fabric higher, the edge caught and lifted too far. Her left nipple slipped free — along with the glint of a purple barbell.

“Oh,” Vallia gasped, freezing. She made a small, startled noise and started to tug her shirt back down.

But Iriali only tilted her head. “Those are cool. I didn’t know you had piercings.”

Vallia blinked again, caught in the compliment. Her hands stilled on the hem of her shirt, holding it awkwardly halfway down.

“I—both are done,” she mumbled, and after a second’s pause, she raised the shirt again — higher this time, deliberately now. Her cheeks flushed as she exposed both of them. The black and purple barbells stood out against her pale skin.

Iriali let her eyes linger. “They suit you,” she said, low and sincere.

That sent a visible shiver through Vallia. She looked away, but a smile tugged at the corner of her mouth.

“I… have more,” she offered, almost too quiet to hear.

Iriali’s attention snapped back to her face. “Do you?” she asked, voice gentle, curious.

Vallia bit her lip. “Y-yeah.”

Iriali’s eyes gleamed. “Show me?”

That did it. Vallia hesitated just long enough to be endearing, then reached for the waistband of her skirt. Her fingers trembled slightly as she slid it lower, letting her sheath part to reveal the length resting against her thigh. Already half-hard. Eight metal barbells glinted along the underside — four purple, four black — arranged in a straight, elegant line.

Iriali exhaled, visibly taken.

“They’re… a frenum ladder,” Vallia added, almost whispering. “They didn’t hurt as much as you’d think.”

Iriali looked up at her. “Can I…?”

Vallia nodded before she could talk herself out of it.

Iriali’s fingers were feather-light as they traced along the piercings. Vallia’s breath hitched instantly, her shaft twitching in response. A glisten formed at the tip, and Iriali leaned in without hesitation, licking it slowly — deliberate, exploratory.

Vallia let out a helpless sound, both hands clutching her skirt. Her knot had started to swell.

Iriali noticed. She wrapped her fingers around its base, curious, squeezing gently.

The reaction was immediate — a startled cry from Vallia, a sudden pulse, and a hot spurt of clear fluid arcing up to splatter across Iriali’s lips and cheek.

Iriali paused, then grinned, licking the corner of her mouth. “Cute trick.”

Vallia covered her face with both hands, glowing red. “…I didn’t mean to.”

“I liked it,” Iriali said simply.

And when Vallia peeked between her fingers, Iriali was still smiling.
