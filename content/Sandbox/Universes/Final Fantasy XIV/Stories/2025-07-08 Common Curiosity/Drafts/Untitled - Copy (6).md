Absolutely â€” letâ€™s begin. To tailor it to your style, here are a few quick choices to confirm before we start drafting:

* ðŸ”¥ **Explicit and raw**
* ðŸŽ­ **Romantic with heat**

**2. Characters:**

* Would you like to use **Vallia and Iriali**, or create **new characters**?
* If new, any preferences for **race**, **gender(s)**, or **dynamic**?

**3. Setting:**

* A quiet night at the **abbey**
* A **hidden glade** under moonlight
* A **warm bathhouse**
* Somewhere else?

**4. Starting Point:**
