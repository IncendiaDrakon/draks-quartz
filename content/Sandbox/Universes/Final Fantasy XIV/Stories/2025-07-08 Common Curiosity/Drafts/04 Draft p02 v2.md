Understood. Here is the same scene, rewritten with **a sensual, direct tone**, **no dialogue**, and **more explicit physical description**, while maintaining a grounded, respectful approach:

Iriali stayed on her knees beside Vallia, her eyes fixed on the shaft resting heavily against her thigh. The piercings gleamed, slick with arousal. Vallia’s chest rose and fell with quick, shallow breaths, her hands gripping the seat beneath her. Her thighs trembled.

Iriali reached out again, wrapping one hand around Vallia’s shaft. The skin was warm and flushed, taut with blood. Her grip was slow, deliberate. Her thumb traced along the frenulum, gliding over the line of pierced flesh. Each barbell was warm against her skin, slick with clear fluid. She pressed the pads of her fingers against each one in turn, measuring the way Vallia’s cock twitched under the contact.

She leaned in.

Her tongue flicked out and dragged slowly over the lowest piercing, tasting skin and metal. Vallia’s hips jerked upward, barely restrained. Iriali continued, licking along the underside, her tongue passing each barbell in sequence. As she moved upward, the tip began to leak again—clear, warm, and slow.

Iriali didn’t pause. She angled her mouth and closed her lips around the tip. Her tongue circled the slit, collecting every drop. Vallia shuddered. Iriali tightened her grip around the shaft, stroking it slowly, the motion steady and firm. She used her other hand to cup the base, squeezing gently behind the knot where it had already begun to swell.

Vallia’s thighs flexed. Her back arched. Her cock jumped in Iriali’s hand.

Iriali lowered her head again, pressing her tongue flat beneath the shaft, sliding up between the ladder of metal. Her strokes became more rhythmic—her hand working from base to tip, her mouth and tongue tracing just behind, licking along the same sensitive line. She kept her pressure even. Vallia’s breath came faster, thighs shaking violently now.

The shaft began to pulse harder in her hand.

Iriali curled her fingers tighter behind the knot and gave it a firm squeeze.

Vallia climaxed.

The first spurt surged upward, thick and sudden, splashing across Iriali’s tongue and lips. She kept stroking. Another pulse followed, and another—each one forcing her hips to jerk, each one coating Iriali’s hand and mouth. The shaft throbbed in long, hard bursts. The knot swelled further beneath Iriali’s fingers, locking that arousal deep into her body.

Iriali didn’t stop until the pulses slowed. Her strokes eased gradually, fingers gliding through the mess across Vallia’s length. She lifted her head only after the final twitch passed, tongue sweeping across her lower lip to clean what it could.

Vallia slumped back into the cushions, her body trembling, chest slick with sweat. Her cock still twitched faintly in her lap, thick with lingering sensitivity.

Iriali sat back on her heels, her fingers wet, her mouth parted, her breath steady.

She kept her eyes on Vallia.

Waiting.
