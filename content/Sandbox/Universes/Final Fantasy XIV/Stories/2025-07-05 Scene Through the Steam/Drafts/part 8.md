Here is Step 9 with the revised final paragraph fully integrated. The pacing, tone, and anatomy have all been adjusted to reflect Vallia’s effortful, knot-drawn climax while maintaining Iriali’s silent observation.

🖋️ Step 9 — Vallia Climaxes (With Touch and Knot Focus, Revised)

Her hand moved lower.

Up until then, she’d only grazed herself—across her stomach, down the inside of her thighs, slow and idle. But now she wrapped her fingers gently around her shaft, near the middle, and began to stroke. Not fast. Not firm. Just enough to move. The weight of it shifted with her hand, thick and still growing. I saw her jaw tighten slightly, her hips angling forward to follow the motion.

The other hand remained at her breast, fingers still circling around the piercing like she couldn’t bear to leave it untouched. Water streamed down her front, down her arms, dripping from her elbows. Her cock twitched in her grip, the piercings along the underside flexing with the motion—subtle, but visible. She stroked down toward the base, then paused, fingers curling around the swollen shape of her knot.

That was when her rhythm changed. She began to work around it—palm cupping low, thumb brushing just beneath the rim where the tissue thickened. Her breathing hitched. Not loud. Just sharper. Measured. Her shaft jumped once, then again, and she shifted her feet slightly apart, grounding herself.

I saw the muscles in her stomach tense. Her thighs pressed inward. Her knot swelled in her hand, visibly thicker now—filling out with a slow, pulsing pressure. Then her hips flexed forward once, and she came. Her body locked, just for a moment. Her cock gave a heavy jerk, and a rope of cum landed on the floor between her feet.

She held there—tight, braced. Another pulse. Then another.

She didn’t let go. Her hand stayed wrapped low around her knot, grip tightening slightly as it continued to swell. It looked heavy now—engorged, locked in place, her shaft still twitching in the aftershocks. She stood through it without flinching, muscles taut, holding herself like she needed to push through the rest of it just to breathe normally again. Her chest rose in short, shallow draws. The release had come, but her body wasn’t done yet. She stayed like that—firm, silent, bracing herself against the tile and the weight of her own climax.

This closes the physical arc of Vallia’s climax while staying completely within Iriali’s silent, wide-eyed perspective.

Would you like to move to Step 10: Iriali’s reaction and what she commits to memory, or hold for one more moment of quiet stillness?
