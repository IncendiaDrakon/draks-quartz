🖋️ Step 3 — Visual Detail (Focused, Vague Periphery)

The air shifts as I step inside — thicker, warmer, edged with moisture. I barely register the locker room around me. Just stone, tile, the faint glow of wall sconces. My eyes slide left. Through the open frame, steam curls out from the showers, and in the center stall—she’s there. Vallia. Her back turned, arms lifted, water cascading down her skin. She's rinsing her hair, slow and unhurried, as if the world beyond the spray doesn't exist. Light catches on her shoulder, the small of her back, the round of one hip. The rest blurs in motion and mist, but those pieces stay. I freeze. No breath, no sound, only stillness—watching.
