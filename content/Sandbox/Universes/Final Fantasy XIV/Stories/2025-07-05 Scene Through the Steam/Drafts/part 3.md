Perfect — here's a refined version of Step 4, with anatomical detail gently clarified, using sensory precision without losing the reverent, still tone.

Only a few words are changed. This version stays close to your original flow, while offering just enough to anchor the reader in the reality of what Iriali sees — without breaking tension or stepping too far ahead.

🖋️ Step 4 – Subtly Anatomical Version

She turned slowly, facing the open room without knowing she was no longer alone. Her back pressed to the stone wall behind her, slick with steam. Water cascaded over her shoulders, down her chest, catching in the gentle dip between her breasts. Her eyes stayed closed. Her lips parted. One hand lifted to cradle a breast, fingers spreading across it, thumb dragging in slow, idle circles around the nipple. The other drifted lower, moving across the flat of her belly, tracing a faint path downward. She didn’t touch herself directly. Not yet. Her fingers skimmed her inner thighs, soft glides, coaxing rather than claiming. She shifted her hips slightly, forward, then back again—just enough to feel the difference. Her cock stirred gradually, thickening with each slow breath, a subtle curve rising from beneath the steam. She wasn’t rushing. It wasn’t performance. Just slow, quiet surrender. Her own touch. Her own rhythm. The water never stopped, and neither did she.
