That’s a great clarification — and your vision is crystal clear now.

For this revision, I’ll adjust the language to:

Keep Iriali’s voice grounded and focused, but not poetic or overly metaphorical

Let each anatomical detail stand out as something new, surprising, and memorable to her

Maintain a natural flow — Vallia isn’t being dissected, just quietly, attentively observed

Imply that Vallia’s typical female anatomy is present, and that her sheath and penis are additional, unexpected features


Here’s the reworked version of Step 8, shaped to your intent:

🖋️ Step 8 — Clean, Grounded Observation

When I try to remember it clearly, it starts with her hands. One was on her breast, fingers moving slowly around the curve. The other traced along her stomach, then lower—over the front of her thigh, the inside of it, back up again. Her movements weren’t rushed. They looked casual at first. Thoughtless, even. But they kept going. And then I started to really look.

Her nipples were pierced. I’d never seen that before. Small barbells, dark against her pale skin. They didn’t shine in the light, but they were obvious, steady. She touched herself like she didn’t even notice them anymore. Like they were just part of her.

That was when I saw the tattoos. I hadn’t noticed them right away. They were faint, a kind of soft blue ink, made up of thin, looping shapes across her body. I couldn’t tell what they were meant to be. Symbols, maybe. Arcane. They seemed to follow her form without interrupting it.

At first, I thought that was the end of it. But then I looked lower. Between her thighs—just above where her clit would be—I saw something else. Something I didn’t recognize. A kind of sheath. It looked like a smooth, fleshy bulge, tucked neatly into the line of her body. It hadn’t moved at all until then.

She kept touching herself gently—her thighs, her belly, her breast—and I watched that bulge start to shift. It swelled a little. I could see something start to press forward from inside. And then it opened. Just a little at first. Just enough to show that something was there, hidden. I stood completely still as her cock began to emerge.

It didn’t come out all at once. It pushed forward slowly, inch by inch, heavier than I expected, thicker. It looked natural on her—like it belonged there, even if I had never seen anything like it before. Along the underside, I counted eight piercings. Bars. Evenly spaced. Fixed in a line from the base up toward the tip.

She didn’t touch it. It just kept rising, full and smooth, as if her body already knew what it wanted. Her knot wasn’t formed yet, but the shape of it was already there, low and wide at the root. I hadn’t imagined any of this. I never even thought she might be like this. But there she was. Standing in the water, her body moving slow and calm like she was all alone.

And I just stood there, watching.
