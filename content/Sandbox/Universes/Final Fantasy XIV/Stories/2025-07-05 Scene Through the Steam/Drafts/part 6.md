Here is Step 7, continuing directly from the last emotional reflection. This step shows Iriali making a quiet, conscious choice to stay and watch ‚Äî and subtly repositioning herself to remain hidden, letting her gaze deepen without distraction or guilt.

üñãÔ∏è Step 7 ‚Äî Iriali Shifts and Commits to Watching

I shifted my weight, careful not to let my boots scrape the floor. The steam helped‚Äîthick and slow, curling through the doorway like breath‚Äîbut I still pressed myself a little farther back, just beyond the full edge of the frame. Not hiding exactly. Just... repositioning. Letting the wall shadow me, letting my presence blur. I wanted to keep watching. Not because I felt entitled. Not because I thought I should. Just because I couldn‚Äôt imagine walking away.

She was still there, caught in her own rhythm, beautiful and unguarded and unaware. I kept my breath quiet. Kept my body still. Let my focus narrow to the shape of her in the water, the way she moved, the way she seemed to glow in the half-light. My thoughts stopped trying to make sense of it. I just watched.

This moment solidifies Iriali‚Äôs presence ‚Äî not as a mistake, but as a choice.

Would you like to proceed directly to Step 8: Full description of Vallia as she continues, with Iriali describing her in detail? If so, feel free to share Vallia‚Äôs visual traits you'd like described ‚Äî otherwise I‚Äôll draw from existing context and keep it consistent.
