Excellent adjustment — this gives Iriali a more natural, unplanned entry that shifts organically into voyeurism. We’ll revise the paragraph to reflect that progression:

She lets herself in (normal behavior)

She’s walking casually

She hears and smells the shower

She glances toward it — then freezes

Only then does her behavior shift: she slows, quiets, hides

🖋️ Revised Paragraph — Iriali’s Innocent Turn Toward the Scene

I let myself in the way I always do — quiet, but not secretive. The stone halls of the annex are warm from the day's stored sun, still holding a faint hum of heat beneath my soles. I’m halfway down the corridor when I hear the water. A steady hiss, like rain behind a wall. Blackberry and wet stone linger in the air, the scent soft and sweet and unmistakably hers. I glance toward the open doorway before I realize what I’m seeing. Then I stop. A single step too close. My breath catches. I shift back, slow, soundless, tucked just out of view — caught in a moment I hadn’t meant to find.

This version lets Iriali's voyeurism emerge from spontaneous discovery, not intent — which aligns with your tone and themes perfectly.

Shall we continue to Step 3: Visual detail — Iriali’s gaze adjusting, beginning to truly see Vallia?
