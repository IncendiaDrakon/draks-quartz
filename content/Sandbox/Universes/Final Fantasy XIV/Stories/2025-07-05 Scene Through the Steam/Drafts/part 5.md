Excellent — you're aiming for emotional clarity over erotic indulgence, and that's a powerful, grounded choice. In this version of Step 6, Iriali will:

Acknowledge what she witnessed

Affirm that she stayed because of who Vallia is, not just what she was doing

Stay in that non-touching, contemplative space — intrigued, not overcome

Possibly hint that this moment changed something, without needing to act on it yet


Here’s your next paragraph:

🖋️ Step 6 — Iriali’s Calm, Honest Reflection

I knew I should’ve looked away. Not because it was wrong—just because it felt too private. Too much. But I didn’t. I watched her because she was Vallia. Because this girl I liked, quietly, stupidly, suddenly started touching herself not twenty feet from me. And I couldn’t look away. Not out of hunger. Not yet. Just… fascination. Admiration, maybe. I’d never seen anyone touch themselves like that. Like it was sacred. Like her own hands knew her better than anyone else ever could. I don’t think she even knew she was beautiful. Not like that. And maybe that’s what made it so hard to leave.

This closes the emotional loop: Iriali stayed because of who Vallia is to her — a girl she likes. Her feelings are soft, honest, and restrained.

Would you like to add a final quiet moment or image to end the scene (e.g., Iriali stepping away, or just staying there longer)? Or is this a natural stopping point for the scene draft?
