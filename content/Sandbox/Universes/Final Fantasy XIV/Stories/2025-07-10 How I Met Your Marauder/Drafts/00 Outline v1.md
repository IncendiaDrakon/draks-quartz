I'll just write my thoughts as a rough outline we can refine
Iriali is a white mage contracted by limsa lominsa marauders
Vallia works alongside marauders to help the on missions
Vallia is a warrior currently
Vallia is out with the marauders and Iriali is called in to be a field healer
Mission gets a bit crazy
A ballista bolt is fired in Iriali's direction on the back line
Vallia jumps in front of it and shatters it with her axe
Her sudden unexpected need to deflect it like that to save Iriali causes splinters to hurt her
Superficial damage, but Iriali rushes to her aid
Iriali is unintentionally sensual when examining Vallia as she heals her
Touches her sensitive ears, which gives Vallia a reaction of fluffy feelings
Vallia awkwardly takes in Iriali's appearance
She's attracted to her
The feeling is low-key mutual
Iriali offers some vaguely clinical and flattering observations of Vallia
The move on with the mission/day
Follow up is Vallia seeking out the "cute white mage" in limsa lominsa
