Perfect ‚Äî your thoughts are clear and evocative. Let me take what you gave and shape it into a cohesive, natural-sounding description that fits the tone of the Dreki Annex:

### üõèÔ∏è Dormitories & Communal Spaces

The **residential wing** of the Dreki Annex is set apart from the main entryway ‚Äî a quieter, more private area reserved for rest and personal reflection. Several modest rooms are arranged along a curved hallway, each designed to house one or two students. These chambers serve as places to **sleep, store belongings, and simply unwind** from the rigor of Studium life.

In the center of the dormitory wing lies a **communal room**, designed for quiet gathering and shared comfort. A **broad table** anchors the space, surrounded by an assortment of **cushions, low couches, and floor mats**, many of which are **woven or padded to accommodate various Viera body types and lounging habits**. Along one wall, a set of **bookshelves** holds a mix of village texts, Studium manuals, and well-thumbed leisure reading ‚Äî some in Sharlayan script, others in the curling hand of Drekhavn record-keepers.

It‚Äôs a place where voices are kept soft, where stories are shared freely, and where the hum of familiarity lingers even across generations.

Would you like to define anything about:

- A **shrine or spiritual space**?
    
- A **kitchen or hearth**?
    
- Any **magical enhancements** to the building?
    

Or would you like to pause here and recap what we've built so far?
