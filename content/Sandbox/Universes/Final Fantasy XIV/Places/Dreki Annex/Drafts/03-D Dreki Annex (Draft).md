Here’s the full description of the **Dreki Annex** so far, incorporating everything you've established:

---

## 📘 **Dreki Annex**

**Location**: Nature-adjacent quarter of Old Sharlayan
**Founder**: Matriarch Reyla Dreki
**Affiliation**: Village of Drekhavn
**Purpose**: Housing for students from Drekhavn who follow scholarly or caster-adjacent paths, designed to ease their transition into Old Sharlayan life while preserving a sense of home.

---

### 🏛️ Exterior

The Dreki Annex follows the clean, academic architecture of Old Sharlayan — pale stone walls, tall archways, and elegantly simple geometry. While it blends in structurally with its surroundings, a narrow garden lines the entrance, setting it apart.

This **garden** is planted with native flora from **Drekhavn**, including both familiar greenery and useful herbs. For students far from home, it serves as a quiet reassurance — a living piece of their homeland just before the threshold.

### 🏠 Interior Layout

#### 🛏️ **Dormitories**

Tucked into the private wing of the annex, two dormitory rooms house the students who reside there. Each room accommodates multiple students and contains space for sleeping, resting, and storing personal belongings. They are simple but comfortable, designed more for quiet stability than luxury.

#### 🪑 **Common Room**

At the heart of the building lies a communal room centered around a large table. The space includes various kinds of seating — benches, mats, and soft cushions — arranged loosely around the central table to support both group activity and solitary downtime. Bookshelves along one wall hold a rotating collection of study materials, leisure reading, and scrolls from both Old Sharlayan and Drekhavn.

#### 🚿 **Bathing and Restroom Facilities**

The bathing suite is laid out similarly to those found in Studium gymnasiums: one large chamber subdivided into three functional areas.

* One section contains **showers**, separated by tiled partitions for modesty.
* Another includes **restrooms** with toilets and sinks.
* A third holds **lockers and benches** where students can store clothes, towels, and personal care items.

#### 🍲 **Kitchen and Dining**

The kitchen is split between **preparation** and **dining** areas. One side is reserved for cooking, with shelves of dried goods, tools, and an enchanted stove. The other side hosts a long table with simple wooden chairs and open access to the adjacent garden view, encouraging slow, shared meals and quiet conversation.
