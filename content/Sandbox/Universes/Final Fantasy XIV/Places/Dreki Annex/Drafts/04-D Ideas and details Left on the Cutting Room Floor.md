Excellent question — and yes, that summary was carefully built from **everything you've given** in this thread. Here's a list of details that **didn’t make it into the final draft**, in case you want to fold them in later or keep them in your notes.

---

## 🧾 **Left on the Cutting Room Floor** (or just lightly touched)

### 1. **Vallia’s Connection**

* The annex was built **with Vallia’s generation in mind**, particularly as a gesture of Reyla's care and vision for her daughter’s future.

  * ✅ *Implied by “future generations” and Reyla's involvement, but not explicitly stated in the current text.*

### 2. **Magical/Symbolic Elements**

* No current mention of:

  * **Charms**, **wards**, or any **aetheric features**
  * A **crest**, **sigil**, or **Drekhavn symbol** (e.g., a draconic spiral, a vine motif, etc.)
  * **Blessed objects**, such as an ancestral token, hearthstone, or altar
  * **Cultural rituals** (like Veilfire Nights or seasonal observances)

### 3. **Tone of Atmosphere**

* The summary leans **practical** and descriptive. You originally mentioned wanting something like **college housing** — communal, cozy, but transitional.

  * The *emotional tone* of homesickness, adaptation, or camaraderie isn’t heavily emphasized yet (but could be, if desired).

### 4. **Viera Cultural Design Influence**

* You noted that the building aligns with **Old Sharlayan architecture**, and we honored that.

  * However, things like **wooden touches**, **curved design motifs**, or **forest symbolism** are **not included** beyond the garden.
  * Could be added subtly in interior decor or layout philosophy.

### 5. **Drekhavn's Personality**

* We described it earlier as **isolated, forested, spiritually rooted**, with a proud and quiet culture.

  * The annex currently conveys its purpose, but not the **emotional or cultural contrast** between Drekhavn and Sharlayan life — which might be a point of identity for students or future scenes.

## ✅ What’s Already Included

Just to confirm, everything else **you specified directly** was included:

* **Matriarch Reyla Dreki** as the founder
* Built by **Sharlayan architects with Drekhavn coordination**
* **For all generations**, but sparked by her daughter’s (Vallia’s)
* Located near **nature** in Old Sharlayan
* Features **a garden of Drekhavn flora**
* Contains **two dormitories**, **common room**, **bath/restroom**, and **kitchen/dining**
* Has a **culturally grounded tone** — not flashy, not alien

Would you like me to:

* Draft an *optional “expansion block”* that includes some of these cut elements for future use?
* Or are you ready to lock this in as the core Dreki Annex description?
