# Ardir

---

## Overview
**Ardir** (pronounced: /ˈɑːrdɪr/, from Veena for 'mountain') is a prominent and resilient Veena settlement located deep within the **Skatay Range's** high-altitude, frost-kissed forests. While its formal name is Ardir, it is widely known by its descriptive nickname, **Ardirborg** (Veena: 'mountain fortress'), a testament to its formidable natural and constructed defenses. The settlement stands as a vital bastion of Veena culture, embodying their deep reverence for nature and their unwavering determination to thrive in a challenging alpine environment.

## Geography and Climate
Ardir is situated amidst the **Northern Peaks** of the Skatay Range, a region characterized by towering, jagged mountains and ancient, snow-dusted evergreen forests. The climate is **harsh alpine** and **frigid**, with heavy snowfalls and biting winds being common. Despite these conditions, the Veena have achieved remarkable harmony with their surroundings, utilizing the natural terrain for defense and sustenance.

## Architecture and Defenses
The architecture of Ardir is a direct reflection of its environment and the Veena's practical ingenuity. Structures are primarily constructed from **sturdy stone and timber**, often **hewn directly from the mountainside** itself. Buildings are designed to withstand the severe weather, with subtly sloped roofs to shed snow and thick walls providing insulation. The settlement's design seamlessly integrates with the ancient trees and rocky outcrops, making it difficult to discern from a distance. This blend of natural and crafted elements reinforces its reputation as a "mountain fortress," providing inherent defensive advantages.

## Inhabitants and Culture
Ardir is predominantly inhabited by **Veena Viera**. Their lives are intricately woven into the rhythms of the mountain and guided by the **"Green Word"**, the spiritual tenets of their race.

* **Female Viera** comprise the primary residents, responsible for the daily management of the settlement, resource allocation, and the training of younger generations in traditional Veena practices and their unique martial arts.
* The elusive **Male Viera**, known as **Wood-warders**, act as Ardir's unseen guardians. They rarely enter the main settlement, instead patrolling the treacherous outer reaches of the Skatay Range and the surrounding forests, protecting their home from both natural hazards and any encroaching external threats or curious outsiders.

## Significance
Ardir serves as a testament to the Veena's enduring resilience and their profound connection to their ancestral lands. It is a place of quiet strength and deep-rooted traditions, a sanctuary fiercely maintained against the backdrop of a wild, beautiful, and unforgiving landscape.
