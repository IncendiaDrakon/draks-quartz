# Skatay Range Lore Is Exceptionally Sparse

Before reshaping Ardirborg, it’s worth noting what FFXIV actually tells us about the Skatay Range:

- The Skatay Range is described simply as the snow-capped mountains marking Dalmasca’s northern border on Othard.
- The only named group there is the Veena Viera, who dwell in its forests as a hunter-gatherer society.
- No official villages, forts, or landmarks are detailed beyond “forests at the foothills.”

In short, the live-service game offers virtually no canon geography, settlement names, or site-specific lore for Skatay—giving us wide latitude to craft Ardirborg without fear of contradicting existing material.

# Ardirborg: “Fortress of the Mountain”

**Etymology**

- Ardir: Adapted from a hypothetical local dialect (or Old Norse _fjall_-style root) meaning “mountain.”
- borg: Norse for “fortress.”
- Combined, Ardirborg simply reads “Mountain Fortress.”

---

## Location & Purpose (High-Level)

- Perched on a rocky spur halfway up the Skatay slopes, overlooking the main pass between Dalmasca and the inland Burn.
- Serves as a watchpoint, meeting hall, and refuge for villagers in times of blizzard or threat.
- Functions as the gathering place for seasonal hunts and as the seat of the local Veena council.

---

## Architectural Touches (Minimalist)

- Built from local granite and timber felled from surrounding pines.
- A single curtain wall rings a central hall—large enough for councils, hearth-fires, and emergency shelter.
- Simple wooden watchtowers at each corner to survey the snowy valleys below.

---

## Cultural Role

- Acts as the de facto capital for any scattered hamlets in the Skatay foothills.
- Hosts the “Cross-Pass Rally,” where Veena hunters and Wood-Warders convene each turning of the season.
- Symbolizes Veena resilience against mountain storms and imperial incursions.

## Next Steps

1. Choose whether Ardirborg remains a loosely described stronghold or if you’d like to layer in light detail (e.g., a single founding legend or a seasonal rite).
2. Decide how Vallia Dreki’s family interacts with it—born within its walls, sent as envoy, etc.
3. Sketch a very high-level narrative hook: a harsh winter siege, an envoy’s return, or a diplomatic overture to Gridania.
