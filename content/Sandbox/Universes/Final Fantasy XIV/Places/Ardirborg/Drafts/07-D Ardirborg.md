# Ardirborg

## Etymology

Ardirborg combines the Veena root _Ardir_—a local adaptation of _Arda_ (“the realm” or “mountain”)—with the Norse suffix **borg** (“fortress”). Together, the name simply reads “Mountain Fortress.”

## Location & Geography

Ardirborg perches on a granite spur halfway up the Skatay Range’s snowy foothills. Dense silverpine forests cloak the lower slopes, while a narrow mountain pass sweeps beneath its timber watchtowers. Morning and evening mists drift through the trees, briefly veiling the hamlet in gray-white haze.

## Settlement & Economy

- Population: A few dozen Ardir families
- Livelihood: Winterhart hunts, foraged herbs, small-scale timbercraft
- Gathering: The annual Cross-Pass Rally brings hunters and travelers together before the deep snows arrive

## Society & Governance

An informal council of elder hunters and aether-wise storytellers oversees the village’s needs. Day-to-day affairs rest with villagers bearing the surname **Ardir**, marking their bond to the Mountain Fortress.

## Reyla Ardir (later Reyla Dreki)

- Birth Name: Reyla Ardir, from the historic line of Ardir matriarchs
- Role: Scholar of Conjuration and Keeper of the Aetheric Ledger, responsible for weather-runes and seasonal rites
- Transformation: Upon leaving Ardirborg to pursue her draconic studies, she adopts the name Reyla Dreki

## Cultural Notes

- Hearth-Aether Library: A small vaulted chamber where conjuration scrolls and weather-binding crystals are stored
- Snowmote Runes: Simple frost-ward glyphs devised to protect the village’s bridges and forest trails
- Cross-Pass Rally: A seasonal gathering in the central courtyard to share news, honor the mountain spirits, and prepare for winter’s onset

Ardirborg remains a loosely sketched fortress-village—vague enough to fit seamlessly into FFXIV’s sparse Skatay lore, yet grounded in a rural Veena setting.
