# Recap: “Ardir” and Ardirborg

---

## 1. The Root “Ardir”

- Adaptation of Arda (“the realm”) shaped to imply **mountain** or **realm-fortified**
- Plausible in-world senses: “Mountain Watch,” “Realm’s Heart,” or “High Stone”
- Two-syllable, hard-consonant form fits Veena phonology and pairs neatly with borg

## 2. Ardirborg (“Fortress of the Mountain”)

- Name: Ardir + borg (Norse “fortress”) → **Mountain Fortress**
- Location: Small Veena hamlet perched on a granite spur in the Skatay foothills
- Population & Economy: A few dozen Ardir families surviving on winterhart hunts, foraged herbs, and timbercraft
- Governance: Informal council of elder hunters and aether-wise storytellers
- Role: Watchpoint on the main pass; gathering place for the Cross-Pass Rally and seasonal hunts

## 3. Reyla Ardir → Reyla Dreki

- **Birth Name**: Reyla Ardir, bearing the village surname to mark her origin
- **Role in Ardirborg**: Scholar of Conjuration, Keeper of the Aetheric Ledger (weather-runes, seasonal rites)
- **Lineage**: Descended from the historic Ardir matriarchs who once led the hamlet
- **Name Change**: Adopts “Dreki” upon leaving, honoring her draconic journey and new path

These are the core points we’ve established—grounded in FFXIV’s sparse Skatay lore but flexible enough to pass as in-world detail. Let me know if you want to tweak any element or add one lightly sketched landmark.
