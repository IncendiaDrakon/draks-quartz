# Ardirborg

Ardirborg is a woodwoven mountain stronghold perched on a narrow granite spur in the Skatay Range foothills. Though no official map records its exact position, the hamlet commands the sole pass between Dalmasca’s lowlands and Othard’s interior.

## Geography & Climate

- Granite Spur  
    • A knife-edge ridge of pale granite, rising roughly two thousand cubits above the valley floor.
- Silverpine Canopy  
    • Ancient trees ring the spur, their root networks woven through planks and platforms.
- Seasonal Mists  
    • Dawn and dusk fogs drift in from the snows above, settling into root-woven decks and wooden railings.
- Winter Drifts & Spring Thaws  
    • Snowbanks reshape trails; meltwater swells hidden springs at the spur’s base.

## Village Layout & Architecture

- Palisade of Laminated Trunks  
    • Rings the outer edge, trunks bound by vine-cord and sealed with clear resin.
- Single Gatehouse  
    • Curved arch of bent beams etched with simple runic grooves, no metal fittings.
- Hearth-Aether Lodge  
    • Vaulted great hall at the spur’s crest, its roof domed by interlaced beams and lit by suspended aether-lamps.
- Resin-Lit Huts  
    • Rounded dwellings clustered just inside the palisade, walls of overlapping plankwork and opaque resin windows.
- Elevated Root-Woven Platforms  
    • Timber decks spun through living roots, serving as watch posts and meeting alcoves.
- Spiral Walkway  
    • Gently sloping ramp carved around a massive root, linking lower huts to the lodge terrace.

## Pathways & Access

- Granite Steps  
    • Rough-hewn treads cut directly into the spur’s rock face, leading from the pass trail to the gate.
- Plank Bridges  
    • Short spans across deep root gullies, bound with vine and moss-filled gaps.
- Night Guard Route  
    • Narrow boardwalk along the inner palisade, lit by mist-resin lanterns.

## Notable Physical Features

- Frostmote Spire  
    • A twisted root formation at the eastern edge, shaped by centuries of wind and resin drips.
- Aetheric Monolith  
    • A carved wooden obelisk near the lodge entrance, inscribed with weather-ward runes and sealed in resin.
- Mist-Lantern Poles  
    • Slim stakes topped with resin globes, positioned at key turns to guide travelers through gray-white haze.

_Ardirborg’s entirely wood-crafted architecture and mist-shrouded setting lend it the air of a living fortress—equal parts craft and nature, its structures breathing with the pulse of the Skatay foothills._
