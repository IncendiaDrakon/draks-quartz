# Ardirborg

## Etymology

Ardirborg blends a local Veena dialect root, _Ardir_ (from _Arda_, “the realm” or “mountain”), with the Norse suffix _borg_ (“fortress”). The name simply signifies “Mountain Fortress.”

## Geography & Setting

- Perched on a granite spur halfway up the Skatay Range’s snow-capped foothills
- Overlooks the narrow pass linking Dalmasca’s lowlands to Othard’s interior
- Encircled by dense silverpine forest, where chill mists pool at dawn and dusk

## Village Layout

- Single curtain wall of hewn granite, tracing the spur’s ridge
- Four timber watchtowers at each corner, offering sweeping views of the pass
- Central courtyard built around a vaulted Hearth-Aether Library chamber
- Clustered wooden dwellings and small outbuildings set just inside the wall

## Inhabitants & Economy

## Governance & Society

## Cultural Practices

- Snowmote Runes: simple frost-ward glyphs carved on trail posts and bridges
- Cross-Pass Rally: annual festival in the courtyard for sharing news and forging alliances
- Hearth-Aether Library: repository of conjuration scrolls, weather-binding crystals, and seasonal rites

## Atmosphere & Narrative Hooks

- Evergreen boughs heavy with snow, their branches creaking under weight
- Mist-shrouded mornings that dampen sound and obscure distant shapes
- Torchlit patrols winding along ramparts when blizzards roar
- Possibilities for conflict: a sudden ward failure, a perilous storm surge, or a diplomatic envoy’s arrival
