# Ardirborg: Veena Fortress of the Mountain

---

## 1. Settlement Overview

Ardirborg is a small Veena hamlet perched on a rocky spur of the Skatay Range, its granite walls and timber watchtowers looming over the main mountain pass. Perpetual snow blankets the silverpine forest below, and drifting aether-mists weave through the trees.

_Population_: A few dozen Ardir families  
_Economy_: Winterhart hunts, foraged herbs, timbercraft  
_Council_: Elder hunters and aether-wise storytellers

## 2. Village Name & Identity

- **Ardirborg** combines a local adaptation of “Arda” (the realm/mountain) with Norse borg (“fortress”).
- Villagers bear the surname **Ardir** (e.g., Reyla Ardir) to signify their bond to the mountain stronghold.
- The name underscores both the hamlet’s defensive purpose and its role as a beacon of Veena tradition in the Skatay foothills.

|---|---|
|Title|Scholar of Conjuration, Keeper of the Aetheric Ledger|

## 4. Cultural Touchstones

- **Cross-Pass Gathering**  
    A seasonal rally at Ardirborg’s courtyard where hunters, wardens, and travelers exchange news before winter’s peak.
- **Snowmote Runes**  
    Simple frost-ward glyphs Reyla devised to protect timber bridges and forest trails.
- **Hearth-Aether Library**  
    A vaulted chamber within the curtain wall housing conjuration scrolls and weather-binding crystals.

## Next Steps & Optional Details

- Define a **single landmark** (e.g., the Frostmote Spire or Aetheric Oak) to flesh out Ardirborg’s map.
- Sketch Reyla’s **first scroll** or a key discovery in her conjuration studies.
- Introduce a **vague legend** about the first snow-ward rune—ideal for Vallia’s coming-of-mage narrative.

Beyond these, we can explore daily life in the fortress, the dynamics of the new elder council, or how Ardirborg’s aetheric wards interact with Vallia’s draconic gifts.
