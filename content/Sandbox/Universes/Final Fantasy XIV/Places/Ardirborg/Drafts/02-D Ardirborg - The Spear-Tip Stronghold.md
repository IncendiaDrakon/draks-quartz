# Ardirborg: The Spear-Tip Stronghold

---

## 1. Name and Etymology

“Ardir” derives from an ancient Veena root meaning “spear-tip” or “sharp ridge.”

Combined with borg (“fortress”), Ardirborg literally means “Fortress of the Spear-Tip.” The name evokes both the settlement’s jagged hilltop perch and its martial heritage.

## 2. Geography and Layout

Ardirborg crowns a narrow promontory at the heart of the Skatay Range’s snowcapped forest.

- Outer Curtain: A horseshoe-shaped stone wall follows the ridge’s contour, deflecting avalanches.
- Inner Keep: A triangular tower rising above the wall, oriented along the hill’s three sharpest points.
- Timber Walkways: Raised wooden galleries link bastions, allowing sentries to patrol above drifted snow.

## 3. Architecture and Key Features

- Spear-Ridge Rampart: Jagged stone’s protruding parapets mimic spear-tips, hammering home the fortress’s name.
- Frost-Warding Runes: Carved into granite lintels, they glow pale green when wind-spirits swirl in.
- Hearth Spire: A central chimney carved to resemble an upturned spearhead, venting warm smoke like a beacon.

## 4. Society and Governance

- Warden-Clan: Led by the Ardir line of Dreki matriarchs, sworn to protect mountain passes.
- Militia Council: Five spear-bearing captains oversee patrols—two forest scouts, two wall-wardens, and one hearth-keeper.
- Civil Quarters: Clusters of heated timber huts nestled behind the ramparts, housing smiths, aether-weavers, and their families.

## 5. Aetheric Phenomena

- Spear-Aether Fissure: A crack in the hill’s bedrock channels aetheric currents upward, empowering runic wards.
- Snow-Song Mists: At dawn, drifting vapors hum in harmonic resonance—a sign villagers interpret as ancestral blessing.
- Lantern-Ash Showers: Sparkling ash drifts from the hearth spire in high winds, believed to guide lost spirits home.

## 6. Founding Legend

Long ago, Ardir the Spearborn—an exile from Lesrekta—climbed the Skatay heights to slay a blizzard wyrm.

He plunged his rune-tipped spear into the creature’s heart, and its frozen breath coalesced into the Hearth Spire.

From that day, his descendants held Ardirborg as the Spear-Warder of the North.

## 7. Rituals and Festivals

- Dawn of the First Spear (midwinter solstice)  
    Spearmen light torches along the ramparts, reenacting Ardir’s ascent to the peak.
    
- Spear-Ward Oath (coming-of-age)  
    Youths carve miniature speartips from yew wood, binding them to the fortress wall in pledge.
    
- Wyrm-Night Vigil (spring thaw)  
    Lantern-Ash is collected and scattered in the forest, honoring the wyrm’s freed spirit.

## 8. Ardirborg in Vallia Dreki’s Journey

- Birth and Legacy  
    Vallia’s mother, Reyla Dreki, once served as Spear-Warden, making Vallia the first Dreki heir born within the inner keep.
    
- Personal Trial  
    Seeking her draconic title “Dreki,” Vallia underwent the Spear-Ward Oath here—her spear carved from wyrm-horn.
    
- Bridge to the World  
    As Vallia ventures beyond the Skatay Range, she carries a fragment of Ardirborg’s hearth-stone, symbolizing Veena resolve.

- Sketch daily life in the civil quarters: forges, aether-weaving halls, and winter hunts.
- Explore narrative hooks: an encroaching ice wyrm, a plot to seize the Spear-Ward runes, or Vallia’s return to Ardirborg as envoy.
