# Reyla Dreki’s Place of Origin

## Skatay Foothills Village

Reyla grew up in a small Veena settlement tucked into the lower slopes of the Skatay Range. Perpetual snow drifts and dense silverpine forests shape daily life, while mountain mists carry faint traces of aether through the trees. The hamlet serves as a seasonal waypoint for hunters and Wood-Warders guarding the pass into Dalmasca’s interior.

These basic points keep Reyla’s origins flexible and in line with FFXIV’s sparse Skatay lore. Let me know if you’d like to tweak any element or add a single defining landmark.
