Ardirborg is a Veena settlement nestled along a granite ridge deep in the Skatay Range. Its name is assumed to mean “Mountain Fortress” is one hard-earned. A place where fortified stone meets the sculpted elegance of pine forest craftsmanship. Though absent from charts, its timber terraces and winding rootways have endured for generations as a quiet watchpoint overlooking the mountain pass.

The village’s structures rise seamlessly from rock and pine alike. Its layout clings to the spur’s contours: elevated platforms stretch from ancient trunks, while spiral ramps carve gentle arcs around exposed roots. Rounded dwellings nest beneath interwoven canopies, each fashioned from curved beams etched with leafwork and flowing knot patterns. Resin sealed, layered plank walls stand stained in muted forest hues and accentuated by ornate motifs.

At the center stands a domed lodge, its carved doorframe studded with mineral inlays and its stone lintel shaped to mirror the horizon. Along the outer trail, sculptures and bas-reliefs emerge from scattered rocks, their delicate spirals and elemental glyphs whispering of older lore.

The Veena of Ardirborg are known beyond their borders, though few admit to knowing their secret paths. Travelers recall the settlement not by name, but for the carved silence that surrounds it. Unmarked on charts, Ardirborg endures in local lore as “the living fortress,” where woodcraft, stonework, and subtle aether converge beneath Skatay’s silent peaks.
