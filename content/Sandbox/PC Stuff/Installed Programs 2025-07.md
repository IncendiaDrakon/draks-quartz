If I remember correctly, I basically did a dump of all installed programs via add/remove programs and then ran a search for all .exe on my drive. This is to help me see what I'd need to reinstall or setup/download on a fresh Windows installation.


I think this is the Microsoft Copilot chat that helped me figure out how to generate these .txt files: https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/7h7CsFf6dX4UArTHkE9v7


[[InstalledPrograms.txt]]

[[ExecutableScan.txt]]
