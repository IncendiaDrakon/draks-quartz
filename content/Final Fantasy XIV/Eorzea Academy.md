Reference note for Eorzea Academy so I don't have to keep looking it up when I forgot what the fuck it's even called. I accidentally called it "Academia Eorzea" a bunch of times, but I think that's just the school in the manga that is entitled "Eorzea Academy". Pedantic, but for social media tagging purposes it's best to remember the title.
