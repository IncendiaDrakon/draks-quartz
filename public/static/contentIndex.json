I introduced her briefly recently in this post. I’m hoping to better flesh out my characters and renders here on my blog here in future posts, but for now here’s some minimal context. I’ve also become notoriously bad at writing and giving context lately, Twitter has rotted my brain with it’s low character limits and lack of attention span. Time to practice my writing! Anyway, expect to see more immersion breaking renders featuring Tiefling Vallia. Baldur’s Gate 3 is probably gonna grip my creative brain for a bit.
